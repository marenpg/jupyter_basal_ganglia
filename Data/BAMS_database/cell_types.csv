1,1CA amacrine retinal cell Nguyen-Legros et al. (NL),Two subpopulations of TH-immunoreactive (TH-I) cells, which actually contain dopamine (Nguyen-Legros et al., 1994), were first demonstrated in the rat retina. Both are amacrine cells (i.e., intraretinal axonless neurons mostly located in the innermost cell row of the inner nuclear layer [INL]). According to the terminology introduced by Mariani and Hokoc (1988), the type 1CA cells (alternatively called large THI-DA cells (Nguyen-Legros, 1987) CA1 cells (Mitrofanis and Provis, 1990) orAcells [Casini and Brecha, 1992]) are large-bodied, intensely TH-I neurons branching mostly in the outermost sublayer (sublayer 1) of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (Figs. 1–4, 8 (black cell), 10, 15). A few 1CA cells are displaced to different levels of the IPL or to the GCL in both rodents and primates (Figs. 6–8 [green cell]), but their processes finally join the DA plexus of the IPL sublayer 1 (Martin-Martinelli et al., 1994; Nguyen- Legros et al., 1992).

2,2CA amacrine retinal cell Nguyen-Legros et al. (NL),The type 2CAcells (alternatively called small THI-CA cells, CA2 cells, or B cells) are small, weakly TH-I neurons projecting to sublayer 3 of the IPL. In rats, their processes are so tiny and so weakly labeled that they appear in sections as unipolar neurons with a Tau bifurcation in the middle of the IPL.,Dopaminergic and GABAergic retinal cell populations in mammals,Nguyen-Legros J., Versaux-Botteri C. & Savy C.,Mihail Bota

(Marvin),The third type of 5-HT1A-IR rcells were medium-sized neurons with triangular or round-shaped somata (20-28 micrometers) and with occasionaly stained, thin dendrites.

9,A17 amacrine cell Wassle (Wassle),The amacrine cell stratified diffusely throughout the inner plexiform layer (IPL). It sparsely branched processes contained varicosities and ramified in the innermost part of the IPL (sublamina 5, SL5). Some of the processes appear to extend beyond the IPL and GCL, because the dendritic field was collapsed into a single plane. From our reconstructions, we propose that this cell type possesses a dendritic-field diameter of more than 150 micrometers and therefore belongs to the wide-field amacrine cells.,Morphological types of horizontal cell in rodent retinae: a comparison of rat, mouse, gerbil, and guinea pig,Peichl L. & Gonzalez-Soriano J.,Mihail Bota

11,AII amacrine cell Wassle (Wassle),Figure 1A,B shows an AII-amacrine cell injected in a retinal slice. The combined phase contrast and fluorescence micrograph of Figure 1A shows the position of the cell body at the INL/IPL border and the stout primary dendrite. Lobular appendages in Figure 1A,B are found at the outer third of the IPL, where they originate from the soma and the primary dendrite. In the inner two-thirds of the IPL, the primary dendrite branches repeatedly to form a conical arborization. The cell body of the LY-filled cell in this view (Fig. 1C) has a diameter of approximately 9-11 micrometers. The lobular appendages (Fig. 1D) cover-depending on the eccentricity-an oval to circular field between 20 pm and 30 pm diameter. The arboreal dendritic field (Fig. 1E) is well filled with fine dendritic branches, and its diameter is between 30 micrometers in central and 50 micrometers diameter in peripheral retina. When focusing through an injected AII-cell, the lobular appendages and the arboreal dendritic field are often offset with respect to the cell body, indicating that the AII cell, like the one illustrated in Figure 1A,B, is not precisely vertically oriented.,Imunocytochemical staining of AII-amacrine cells in the rat retina with antibodies agains parvalbumin,Wassle H, Grunert U & Rohrenbeck J,Mihail Bota
12,alpha retinal ganglion cell Peichl (Peichl),In cells with alpha-type morphology (Figs. 2, 3), dendritic fields were relatively large and basically monostratified within the IPL. Several stout primary dendrites emerged radially from the soma. These cells (Figs. 2, 3) are contained within Perry's ('79) type I category and are classified here as rat alpah cells because of their resemblance to other mammalian alpha cells (Boycott and Wassle, '74; Peichl et al. '87a, b).,Alpha and delta ganglion cells in the rat retina,Peichl L.,Mihail Bota

18,basket neuron Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),Compared with the granule cell, the basket cell is quite complicated. It receives sysnapses from parallel fibers and to a limited extent from climbing fibers, but it devotes its entire axonal output to the Purkinje cells with the possible exception of a few contacts on other basket cells and Golgi cells. A large number of widely dispersed parallel fibers converge on its dendrites, but its axon sends divergent impulses to only a small number of Purkinje cells. The basket cell has a roughly pyramidal or ovoid shape, and it lies in the lower third of the molecular layer with its long axis parallel to the Purkinje cell layer in the sagittal plane. In Nissl preparations little more can be seen of it than its triangular or oval cell body, about 10 micrometers long....Ramon y Cajal (1888a and b) was the first to discover the characteristic terminal plexus elaborated around the Purkinje cell body by the axons of these cells. He named this formation the pericellular nest (nid pericellulaire). His finding was quickly confirmed by Kolliker (1890), who referred to the same structure as a fiber basket (Faserkorb), and to the cells that gave rise to it as basket cells (Korbzellen).,The vertebrate retina,Rodieck R.W,Mihail Bota
19,basket neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),Within the upper part of the Ju, there is a third neuronal type, the basket cell (BC), which accounts for about 8% of the neurons observed in the nucleus. The BCs correspond to the second type of short-axon neurons observed in the Ju (Fig. 4A,B). The soma of these neurons is ovoid, measuring from 18 to 22 micrometers in the longest axis. The perikaryon gives rise to a dorsal dendrite and one or two lateral dendrites, which in both cases ramify quickly into long secondary shafts and rarely provide short tertiary branches. Four additional features characterize the dendrites of BC: They follow a straight trajectory; they display varicosities; they bear a few dendritic spines; and at least one set of dendrites is meshed into the axonal bundles surrounding the Ju. In every cell, the axon descends from the lower pole of the soma, and shortly afterward gives rise to a number of recurrent fibers adopting the form of typical axonal arcades that return to the dendritic field proper (Fig. 4A,B). These recurrent axonal branches are in apposition to the adjacent somata and/or to proximal dendrites of bipolar and pyramidal neurons. In three of the sampled neurons, the axon proceeds farther ventrally, issuing additional horizontal collaterals along its way. Both the descending axon and the horizontal collaterals appear to terminate as en passage and terminal boutons on the shafts and spines of bipolar and triangular neurons (see below; Fig 4B).,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota
19,basket neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The core of the Ov exhibits a neuron type that strongly resembles the basket cells described by Ramon y Cajal (1904) in the mammalian neocortex and by Larriva-Sahd (2004) in the adult rat Ju of the BST. BCs have a small (15–20 micrometers), triangular or pear-shaped soma that gives rise to two or four primary divergent dendrites that divide sequentially into secondary and terminal (i.e., tertiary) branches (Fig. 10D,E). Three characteristics are consistently observed in BC dendrites: 1) shafts hold distinct varicosities, 2) shafts are virtually devoid of spines, and 3) the dendritic field they form is relatively small (150–180 micrometers). The axon arises from the soma, and it is usually directed ventrally. Typically, the axon gives rise to transverse collaterals, which curve in the form of arcades that return toward the neuron’s own dendritic tree (see Jones and Hendry, 1984). Occasional straight collaterals, usually from the main axon, descend farther ventrally. An additional feature of certain BCs is that their recurrent collaterals appear to contact the dendritic processes of the cell (Fig. 10D), resembling that documented by Fairen et al. (1982) for the homologous neurons in the isocortex, the so-called autapses (Table 2).,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat. II.

21,beaded neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),A seventh type of interneuron consists of a cell located within the core of the nucleus that is termed a beaded neuron (BN) because of its rounded soma and numerous spherules along both dendrites and axon (Fig. 11). The soma measures from 12 to 17 micrometers in its widest axis and is nearly spherical, having a rather smooth profile. The soma issues two or three short primary dendrites, which usually run horizontally. After a short distance (10–40 micrometers), these proximal branches give rise to sets of two to five long, secondary dendrites. The occurrence of third-order dendrites is variable, as is their length (20–150 micrometers). A defining characteristic of BN dendrites is the presence of distinct varicosities that are virtually devoid of dendritic spines, similar to those described by Belenky et al. (2003) for certain retinal ganglion cells.The axon of BNs arises from the soma and runs transversally or diagonally with respect to the fibers of the StT, reaching the neuropil of the Ov or adjacent nuclei (Table 2), where it resolves. In about two-thirds of the sampled neurons, the axon provides multiple straight collaterals leaving the parent fiber orthogonally (Fig. 11). In the rest of the cases, no axonal collaterals were observed. The BN axon and its collaterals also exhibit a series of small spherules (i.e., 0.3–0.5 micrometers) united by thin axonal bridges.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

24,blue-sensitive cone Szel and Rohlich (SR),With regard to the recent findings of Neitz and Jacobs (1986). much more doubt is left about the spectral characteristics of the other, extremely rarely occurring, cone type labelled by mAb OS-2. If this cone type contains a visual pigment with a different colour sensitivity, the only logical alternative is that it is blue-sensitive. The assumed blue sensitivity of OS-2 positive cones in the rat is supported by the selective staining of blue cones by OS-2 in other mammalian species in our experience (Szel et al., 1988).,Two cone types of rat retina detected by anti-visual pigment antibodies,Szel A. & Rohlich P.,Mihail Bota
25,BNSTAL-5HT (HYP) neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),Collator note: neuron type defined on the physiological response when serotonin is applied in BNSTALG tissue.5-HT(Hyp) always has a hyper-polarization response. The distribution of this neuron type (population) is assumed to be within the boundaries of BNSTAL as defined in Levita et al. 2004.,Bi-directional modulation of bed nucleus of stria terminalis neurons by 5-HT: molecular expression and functional properties of excitatory 5-HT receptor subtypes,Guo J.-D., Hammack S.E., Hazra R., Levita L.& Rainnie D.G.,Mihail Bota
26,BNSTAL-5HT (HYP-DEP) neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),Collator note: neuron type defined on the physiological response when serotonin is applied in BNSTALG tissue.5-HT(Hyp-Dep) has two components, that is, a membrane hyperpolarization immediately followed by a depolarization deflection. The distribution of this neuron type (population) is assumed to be within the boundaries of BNSTAL as defined in Levita et al. 2004.,Bi-directional modulation of bed nucleus of stria terminalis neurons by 5-HT: molecular expression and functional properties of excitatory 5-HT receptor subtypes,Guo J.-D., Hammack S.E., Hazra R., Levita L.& Rainnie D.G.,Mihail Bota
27,BNSTAL-5HT neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),In agreement with McDonald (1983), neurons of the BNSTAL had a characteristic oval soma (approximately 22 X 15 micrometers) from which emanated two to four primary spine-sparse dendrites. The length of the primary dendrites ranged from 126 to 50 micrometers. Unfortunately, full morphometric reconstruction on several of the recovered cells was not possible due to the loss of some of the dendritic arbor during tissue processing. Collator note: the distribution of these neurons are shown in a single figure (Fig.1 page 586). It was assumed that BNSTAL of Levita et al. may correspond with the rostral levels of BSTal and BSTad of Swanson-1998 (Atlas Levels 16-17). It is possible that BSTov is also included in the BNSTAL of Levita et al., but no indication of this was found in the text.,5-Hydroxytryptamine1A-like receptor activation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis: electrophysiological and behavioral studies,Levita L., Hammack S.E., Mania I., Li X.-Y., Davis M. & Rainnie D.G.,Mihail Bota

29,BNSTAL-5HT(NR) neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),Collator note: neuron type defined on the physiological response when serotonin is applied in BNSTALG tissue.5-HT(NR) does not present any type of electrical response.

30,BNSTALG Type I neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),Type I neurons accounted for 29% of all recorded BNSTALG neurons, had a resting membrane potential (Vm) of -60.0 ± 0.6 mV, and a mean input resistance (Rm) of 452.6 ± 30.0 MOhms. In response to transient (750-ms) hyperpolarizing current injection, Type I neurons exhibited a characteristic depolarizing sag (rectification) in their voltage response that was both time dependent and voltage dependent, such that the amplitude and rate of onset of the rectification increased with increasing membrane hyperpolarization (see Fig. 2B, Type I). Type I neurons also exhibited a transient depolarizing rebound potential on termination of the hyperpolarizing current injection, the amplitude and rate of onset of which also increased with increasing levels of initial membrane hyperpolarization.,Differential expression of intrinsic membrane currents in defined cell types of the anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,Hammack S.E., Mania E. & Rainnie D.G.,Mihail Bota
31,BNSTALG Type II neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),Type II neurons were the most abundant of BNSTALG neurons, accounting for 55% of all recorded cells. These neurons had a Vm of -58.0 &plusm; 0.5 mV and an Rm of 377.4 & 15.7 MOhms.. Type II neurons also exhibited a depolarizing sag in response to hyperpolarizing current injection that was similar to that described for Type I neurons. However, in contrast to Type I neurons, the amplitude and rate of onset of the rebound depolarization observed at the termination of the hyperpolarizing current injection were always much larger than the degree of depolarizing rectification observed. Significantly, the amplitude of the rebound depolarization often surpassed action potential threshold and triggered a rebound burst of action potentials (see Fig. 2B, Type II), suggesting that Type II neurons express additional active currents that could be modulated by prior membrane hyperpolarization. After the initial burst of action potentials, Type II neurons either fire in a regular pattern (Fig. 2A, Type II), fire in bursts, or stop firing altogether (accommodate). The variability of this second response is likely explained by the differential expression of outward rectifying currents and calcium-dependent potassium currents, and/or differences in the properties of the calcium currents that generate the initial burst. These differences suggest that even within Type II neurons there is heterogeneity in their physiological responses.,Differential expression of intrinsic membrane currents in defined cell types of the anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,Hammack S.E., Mania E. & Rainnie D.G.,Mihail Bota
32,BNSTALG Type III neuron Hammack et al. (Hammack),Type III neurons made up 16% of recorded BNSTALG neurons, had a Vm of -64 ± 1.1 mV, and an Rm of 357.8 ± 38.1 MOhms. Unlike Type I and Type II neurons, Type III neurons did not show a prominent time-dependent depolarizing sag in response to hyperpolarizing current injection. Instead, Type III neurons exhibited a fast time-independent rectification that became more pronounced with increased amplitude of current injection (Fig. 2B, Type III). Unlike the time-dependent rectification observed in Type I and Type II neurons, no rebound depolarization was observed in Type III neurons on the termination of the hyperpolarizing current injection. These properties are similar to those previously reported in other brain regions after activation of an inwardly rectifying potassium current KIR (De Jeu et al. 2002; Nisenbaum and Wilson 1995), which suggested that Type III neurons may preferentially express this current.,Differential expression of intrinsic membrane currents in defined cell types of the anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,Hammack S.E., Mania E. & Rainnie D.G.,Mihail Bota

40,BST-medial neurons McDonald (McDonald),Neurons are basically similar in all portions of the [BST medial] subdivision (Figs. 5,7,8). Most cells have ovoid perikarya that are 14-18 micrometers long and 10-13 micrometers wide. Two or three dendrites arise from the cell body and branch rather sparingly. Dendrites may extend 300-400 micrometers and vary in spine density. Axons originate from cell bodies, primary dendrites, or the proximal portion of secondary dendrites (compare cells B,C, and E of Fig. 7.) and do not appear to display a preferred orientation. Usually only the initial 50-100 micrometers of the axon impregnates but in other cases more distal portions of the axon are seen.Well-impregnated axons often exhibit beaded cotlateraLs that may extend long distances before passing out of the section (e.g., Fig. 7, ceil C). Axon hiliocks and perikarya may exhibit spines, especially in young animals impregnated with the rapid Golgi technique (Figs. 4,7).,Neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis: a Golgi study in the rat,McDonald A.J.,Mihail Bota

43,BSTju-restricted neuron McDonald (McDonald),This subdivision consists of neurons with small, ovoid perikarya (9-13 micrometers in diameter) and several thin dendrites that give rise to numerous, wavy branches (Fig. 2, cell C). Dendritic branches, which have a dense covering of spines, are restricted to the confines of this small region (Fig. 2). Axons originate from the perikaryon or the proximal portion of a primary dendrite but can only be followed for a short distance before they leave the section or cease to impregnate. They usually emit one or more thin, beaded collaterals that appear to remain confined to the subdivision.

44,BSTse bipolar neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),A first type of neuron providing extrinsic inputs to the Ov is located between the dorsal part of the BST and the root of the septal StT, just beside the lateral ventricle. According to the cytological criteria recommended by Peters (1984) to classify neurons, SEs correspond to bipolar neurons. Thus, SEs are characterized by an oval somata from which originate paired primary dendrites running in opposite directions. In about half of the neurons studied here, one of the primary dendrites may nonetheless be bent in varying degrees, from a horizontal (Fig. 6, neuron b) to an orthogonal (Figs. 6, neuron a, and 14) position. The soma of an SE is ovoid, with an irregular profile measuring from 18 to 24 micrometers n the longest axis. Primary dendrites are relatively short (20–60 micrometers in length) and give rise to long secondary branches that occasionally ramify into tertiary, terminal dendrites. The SE dendrites are either smooth or exhibit a low to moderate number of spines.

45,burst LTS neuron Hoffman et al. (HTD),The third type of neuron encountered in this region conformed with type-III criteria (Tasker and Dudek, '91).

They also displayed strong inward rectification in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses (fig. 5B).,Immunohistochemical differentiation of electrophysiologically defined neuronal populations in the region of the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus,Hoffman N.W, Tasker J.G. & Dudek F.E.,Mihail Bota

51,candelabrum cell Laine and Axelrad (LA),The perikaryon [...] is always located inside the PC [Purkinje cell] layer. It is squeezed, either between the bulging parts of the PC somata or in the space left free between their upper poles, just at the level of the lower border of the molecular layer. The soma has usually a vertically elongated pear with smaller dimensions than the nearby PC somata. The cell body surface bears pedunculate or sessile spines. The dendritic pattern is characterised by the constant association of one or two long vertical molecular dendrites ans of a few short oblique granular ones. The dendritic tree spans roughly 150 micrometers in the parasagittal plane, whereas schematic 3D reconstruction shows that its mediolateral extent is restricted to less than 50 micrometers. This flattened aspect of the molecular dendritic tree is a feature it shares with most of the other dendritic trees spreading this layer. The initial segment of the axon originates directly from the perikaryon (Figs. 1B, 2B, arrowhead). It has a characteristic conical shape, rather thick in respect to the cell body. The axon then extends horizontally, usually coursing the upper PC layer for a certain distance winding around the different elements of the neuropil. We have seen two distinct patterns for the spatial spread of this axonla domain. In certain cases the area delimited by the axonal branches will totally overlap the area spanned by the cell's dendritic tree (Fig 1A), without, however, intermingling with the plane of distribution of these molecular dendrites. In some other cases, the axon spreads lateral to the dendritic arborisation, at a more or less great distance (Fisgs. 3A-5A). Some intermediate cases can be seen (Fig. 2A).,The candelabrum cell: a new interneuron in the cerebellar cortex,Laine J. & Axelrad H.,Mihail Bota

57,cerebellar granule cell Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),The granule cells of the cerebellar cortex are among the smallest nerve cells in the body. The number of granule cells is enormous, and they are densely packed in the cerebellar cortex of all vertebrates. Rapid Golgi preparations show that the granule cell has an unmistakably characteristic shape, a globular cell body with three or four short, radiating dendrites. These processes are typically sinuous, branching only at their ends, where they produce a gnarled, claw-like, sometimes varicose inflorescence. The dendrites from several granule cells, perhaps as many as six, converge upon the mossy fiber terminal. The axon of the granule cell originates from the cell body, or frequently from the thicker stem of a dendrite, and snakes its way up through the granular layer. In the upper third of the granular layer, axons from neighboring granule cells come together to form thin bundles, which penetrate between the Purkinje cell bodies and ascend into the molecular layer. In this layer each granule cell axon bifurcates like a T, giving rise to a pair of long, thin fibers, 0.1-0.2 micrometers in diameter, running in opposite directions parallel to the longitudinal axis of the folium (Figs. 5 and 53). For this reason they were termed parallel fibers by Ramon y Cajal (1888b).,Cerebellar cortex. Cytology and Organization,Palay L.S. & Chan-Palay V.,Mihail Bota

59,cholinergic amacrine cell Voigt (V),In the rat retina an antibody against choline-acetyl transferase (ChAT) stains two cell populations (Fig. 1). One group has the soma at the inner border of the inner nuclear layer (INL) where amacrine cells are normally found. The dendrites stratify in a narrow band in the outer third of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The cells of the other population have their somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL); their dendrites stratify in the central third of the IPL and their are quite likely displaced amacrine cells. The position of both dendritic strata within the IPL and the distance between them is constant, whereas soma position in relation to the starta is more variable for both populations, depending on the surrounding tissue. ... In rat these cells have...cup-shaped nucleus with a crown of cytoplasm that prompted their name in the rabbit. In ChAT-positive amacrine cells the cupped eccentric nucleus is also clearly visible and counter-staining of ChAT-immunoreacted retinae with cresylviolet reveals that the rat coronate cells are the cholinergic amacrines.,Cholinergic amacrine cells in the rat retina,Voigt T.,Mihail Bota
60,cholinergic neuron Armstrong, Saper, Zaborszky et al. (A-S-Z et al.),Collator note: cholinergic neurons of the rat CNS constitute a large and complex class of neurons, usually divided by regions where they where identified, projections, and morphology.

61,class A neuron Webster-Gabbott (W-G-DLG),The first and most common group (class A of Grossman et al. 1973) (Fig. 1) consists of cells which vary in soma diameter from 11 to 20 microns (mean = 14.0 microns). These cells have 4-8 primary dendrites, of roughly equal size, each of which branches between 6 and 12 microns from the soma to form 2-3 secondary dendrites. Secondary as well as tertiary dendrites (when present) possess irregularly spaced appendages which are either short and blunt in appearance, or appear as short, thin stalks with terminal swellings. These latter appendages were often seen at dendritic branch points, and resemble the grape-like clusters described on neurons of the cat LGN (Guillery 1966).,Morphology of identified relay cells and interneurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the rat,Webster M.J, Rowe M.H.,Mihail Bota
62,class B neuron Webster-Gabbott (W-G-DLG),The second group of cells seen in our Golgi material (class B of Grossman et al. 1973; Fig. 2) typically had small somas (10 microns) and only 2-3 primary dendrites which often extended several hundred microns from the soma. These primary dendrites usually branched only once and the secondary dendrites were rarely seen to branch. Thin, axon-like processes were occasionally seen arising from these cells (Fig. 2), but they could not be traced for any distance and could not be positively identified as axons. Class B cells were most commonly seen in the lateral portions of the nucleus, and their dendritic arbors were typically oriented parallel to the lateral border of the LGN. When members of this class had somas located away from the borders of the LGN, the orientation of their dendritic arbors was less pronounced (Fig. 2).,Morphology of identified relay cells and interneurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the rat,Webster M.J, Rowe M.H.,Mihail Bota
63,common spiny neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The CSN is the most frequent cell type (44%) and short axon neuron found in the Ov (Fig. 8). Neurons classified as CSN are a heterogeneous group of spiny interneurons scattered throughout the core and, occasionally, the shell of the nucleus. This cell type bears strong similarities to the type described by MacDonald (1983) in “the lateral subdivision of the BST,” which clearly corresponds to the Ov reported by Ju and Swanson (1989). CSNs together with neurogliaform neurons (see below) are by and large the most important source of intrinsic axonal plexuses to the neuropil of the Ov. CSNs share the following somatodendritic characteristics: 1) somata are ovoid or star shaped, measuring 16 micrometers in their longest axis; 2) primary dendrites have two or three short branches (10–40 micrometers) that run divergently; 3) dendrites exhibit distinct varicosities; and 4) second- and third-order dendrites are covered by a moderate number of spines. The CSN axon arises from the soma or, more commonly, from the base of a primary dendrite. A signal feature of the axon is that it undergoes successive, dichotomous ramifications, which outline square areas of neuropil harboring stained somata, dendrites (Table 2), and unstained somata. It should be emphasized that CSNs exhibit varying degrees of somatodendritic complexity from bipolar to double bouquet or stellate cells (see Peters and Jones, 1984); however, their clear-cut dendritic features coupled with the pattern of axonal branching are the most constant and defining criteria.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

64,cone Cajal-Detwiler-Walls (C-D-W),These elements are shorter and less abundant than rods, except in the fovea centralis, where they are the only visual cells present. They are shaped like bottles sitting on the outer limiting membrane with their necks extending into spaces between rods (Figs. 188e and 190B). Their length increases from the periphery of the retina to the macula lutea. Like rods, cones present two segments. The short, cone-shaped, higly variable outer segement is covered with a very thin hyaline film, and its contents are homogeneous and quite refractive in fresh tissue. In contrast, its superimposed lamellae may be easily dissociated. The inner segment is much longer as well as much thicker, and its granular cytoplasm is lightly stained by carmine, hematoxiline, and the basic aniline dyes.,Histology of the nervous system of man and vertebrates.

64,cone Cajal-Detwiler-Walls (C-D-W),...not only are cone-type nuclei abundant in the rat retina, but their cells are easily seen, under good lenses, to be typical cones. Except for the absence of a differentiated ellipsoid, or Faddenapparat, they are essentially similar to primate cones. The cones are much like those figured by Menner in his ubernormal mouse. Their nuclei are large, mostly more ovoid than the one illustrated here, and all lie within the sclerad third of the outer nuclear layer - the vast majority being in contact with the limitans, which is the normal location of cone nuclei in vertebrates in general.

66,COS1-positive cone Szel and Rohlich (SR),Three photoreceptor cell types can be distinguished in retinal sections from rat eyes: OS-2 positive cones, COS-1 positive cones and anti-rhodopsin positive rods (Fig. 1). The overwhelming majority of photoreceptor cells were recognized by AO, a polyclonal antibody raised against bovine opsin, and can unequivocally be considered to be rods [Fig. 1(C)]. Cells labelled with either COS-1 or OS-2, monoclonal antibodies to cone visual pigments in mammals, can be taken as cones [Figs 2(A) and (B)]. The mutual complementarity of the labelling with the three antibodies further supports their cone-like nature.,Two cone types of rat retina detected by anti-visual pigment antibodies,Szel A. & Rohlich P.,Mihail Bota

71,deep horizontal cell Langer (Langer-SC),Collator note: deep horizontal cells are considered a separate type of the horizontal cell on the basis of the cell body localization.

Otherwise, the definition of the deep horizontal cell is identical with that of the class horizontal cell.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
72,deep vertical fusiform cell Langer (Langer-SC),Deep vertical fusiform cells have cell bodies about 20 micrometers wide and their dendrites extend from the upper margin of the zone of vertical cells to the depth of the zone of optic fibers perhaps even deeper. The superficial and deep fields are usually notably different in the manner in which the dendrites branch and spread, the over-all size of the fields, the shapes of the fields, the type and density of spines, and the caliber of the dendrites.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
73,deeper long axon stellate cell Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),In the middle third of the molecular layer and deeper, stellate cells with very long axons are encountered. These are distinct from the superficial short axon cell, and constitute a second type (Figs. 187C, !88D, 190, and 191). Their major dendrites emerge from the cell body and give rise to a large number of contorted branches that radiate outwards into the molecular layer, dividing frequently. Resembling the dendrites of the more superficial stellate cells, they also have few spiny appendages. The axon can extend for lengths of up to 450 micrometers (Fig. 188D), always running in the parasagittal plane and slipping through the fan-like arborescence of the Purkinje cell dendrites.,Cerebellar cortex.

74,delta retinal ganglion cell Peichl (Peichl),The second cell type is termed delta because the dendritic branching pattern resembles that of cat retinal ganglion cells (Boycott and Wassle, '74; Kolb et al., '81; Wasle et al., '87a). The primary dendites of the delta cell...are thinner, and the branches are more curving and wavy than in alpha cells (see also Fig. 14).

79,diffuse amacrine cell Leure-Dupree (LD),These cells (figs. 11-14) are similar in morphology to the diffuse amancrine cells of Cajal ('11) and the stratified amacrine cells of Polyak ('41). The perikarya of these cells were situated in the inner plexiform layer just below the cell bodies of the bipolar cells. Processes extended from the vitreous surface of the cell body and showed characteristic delicate varicosities on their terminals, imparting a tufted brush-like appearance, a characteristic feature of diffuse amacrine cells (Cajal '11; Polyak, '41; Boycott and Dowling, '69). In some instances an apical process was observed to extend from the sclerad surface of the amacrine cell body and, instead of projecting towards the photoreceptor terminal, it curved and entered the inner plexiform layer. The range of diameter of the dendritic tree of 54 diffuse amacrine cell processes was 25-60 micrometers.,Observations of the synaptic organization of the retina of the albino rat: a light and electron microscopic study,Leure-Dupree A.E.,Mihail Bota
80,diffuse ganglion cell Bunt (Bunt),The diffuse ganglion cells (i.e., those whose dendrites did not show stratification, but rather ramified at all levels of the inner plexiform layer) were the most frequently impregnated in this study. The cells were characterized by somata 12-21 micrometers in diameter and one or several relatively thin apical dendrites which branched and ramified throughout the inner plexiform layer. The branches had a very delicate, often beaded appearance, with occasional spines. Some had relatively small, circumscribed dendritic fields (84-132 micrometers) (Fig. 1) and others had more complexly branched, wider fields extending from 160 to 360 micrometers in diameter (Figs. 2-4).,Ramification patterns of ganglion cell dendrites in the retina of the albino rat,Bunt A.H.,Mihail Bota
81,displaced NPY-immunoreactive amacrine cell Oh et al. (Oh),In the GCL, NPY immunoreactivity was localized to small to medium cell bodies. Primary processes that entered the IPL and branched into secondary processes characterized these NPY immunoreactive cells. These processes appeared to ramify extensively and diffusely in stratum 5 of the IPL (Fig. 3C). The mean somal diameter of displaced NPY-immunoreactive amacrine cells was 9.3 & plusmn; 2.2 micrometers (SD) in the central retina and 10.7 & plusmn 0.9 micrometers in the peripheral retina (Fig. 5)....In the GCL, the highest density of NPY-immunoreactive displaced amacrine cells was in the central and supratemporal regions of the retina. The highest density was 175.7 ± 20.4 cells/mm2 in the central region around the optic disc and in the region supratemporal to the optic disc. The density decreased toward the periphery , with a minimun density of 25.3 ± 5.4 cells/mm2 in the nasal and inferotemporal margins of the retina (Fig. 6, Bottom).,Distribution and synaptic connectivity of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive amacrine cell in the rat retina,Oh S.-J., D'Angelo I., Lee E.-J., Chun M.-H., Brecha N.C.,Mihail Bota

(Kondo),In the retina ipsilateral to the FB injection, cells retrogradely labeled with FB were found predominantly in its lower-temporal regions, and to a lesser extent in its upper and nasal parts (Fig. 1). They amounted to 220-250 cells per retina, and comprised both large (more than 20 micrometers in diameter) and small (less than 20 micrometers in diameter) cells.

(NL),All TH-I cells in the amacrine cell layer having at least one process lying more sclerad than its soma (i.e., in the outer part of the INL, the OPL, and the ONL, inrrespective of ramification) were considered to be IPc. The cell bodies of DA-IPCcs in the rat retina were heavily TH-I (1CA cells) round or ovoid (Fig. 1a, e). Their mean cross-sectional area (174.1 ± 19.6 micrometers2) and mean diameter (14.8 ± 0.8 micrometers; n = 31) did not significantly differ from those of the general DA cell population (cross-sectional area 174.1 ± 25.3 micrometers2, mean diameter 14.8 ± 1.1 micrometers; n=54; Fig.2).

88,fast-conducting retinal ganglion cell Fukuda-physiological (F-physio),Further support for the three-group classification of ganglion cells was gained by physiological measurements of conduction velocities of ganglion cell axons. By recording axonal or cellular discharges in the retina values of 16.8 ± 1.5, 11.4 ± 1.0 and 6.3 ± 1.1 m/sec were obtained as the average velocities of the fast, intermediate and slow conducting axons.

89,fusiform neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),Among the principal neurons of the core of the Ov, the most common cell type (Table 1) is a fusiform neuron with rather long, slender dendrites originating wide (>700 micrometers), narrow dendritic fields (Fig. 12A, neurons a and d). We have grouped this and a heterodendritic neuron (see below) as wide-range neurons, based on the dimensions of the dendritic field. The soma and proximal dendrites of FNs are located primarily within the core of the nucleus. The perikaryon is long (33 micrometers) and slender, and it assumes a fusiform or obtuse triangular shape. From the soma of FNs, two or three primary dendrites extend in divergent directions. Secondary dendrites arise either proximally or far distally and provide correspondingly long (>350 micrometers) or short (<150 micrometers) branches. Aside from the length, these dendrites are thin and have discreet varicosities and a low number of dendritic spines (Fig. 13). The dendritic fields from about one-third of the FNs extend beyond the con- fines of the Ov, penetrating the neuropil of the adjacent structures, particularly the triangular (Fig. 12A, neuron a), rhomboid, or interfascicular (Fig. 12A, neuron d) nuclei. The axon leaves from the root of a proximal dendrite and follows a slightly curved or wide, undulating trajectory, usually providing two to four long straight collaterals. As a rule, the axon travels for a considerable distance (>0.6 mm) through the Ov neuropil and leaves the Ov ventrally or dorsally (Table 2).,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

91,GABA-IR neuron, BST Sun and Cassell (SC),Only GABA-IR neurons in the anterolateral BNST were adequately Golgi-impregnated (Figs. 9 and 10). These cells have round perikarya with moderate to densely spiny dendrites and closely resembled the medium-sized sipiny neurons described by McDonald ('83) and also identified here in the CeL (cf. cells N1 in Figs 7 and 9).

96,giant ganglion cell Bunt (Bunt),Several examples have been found of giant cells similar to those described by Polyak in the primate retina as having large somata (20 micrometers or greater) and relatively thick dendritic branches which were smooth and spine-free, radiating outward from the soma to extend throughout the inner plexiform layer. The diameter of the dendritic spread reached 260 micrometers.,Ramification patterns of ganglion cell dendrites in the retina of the albino rat,Bunt A.H.,Mihail Bota
97,globular cell Laine and Axelrad (LA),These cells are found scattered in the different folia of the vermis, thus appearing to be distributed throughout the cerebellar cortex....The soma nearly always (14/15) lies in the upper third of the granular layer (Figs. 1, 2 and 4) or inside the PC layer. In all globular cells the soma has a multipolar morphology, with radiating dendrites, a pattern highly reminiscent of that of Golgi cells. The pericaryon is more or less rounded, most often globular, and has a mean great axis of 14.5 micrometers and a mean somatic area of 129 micrometers2 . Nevertheless, some somata are more or less triangular or polyedric. The outstanding majority of our neurons (12/15) have no more than three to four dendritic trunks (see Table 1) and, frequently, the neurites draw a cross-like figure: three thick dendrites extend at right angles from the three cardinal points of the soma, whilst the axon emerges at the fourth (Figs. 1, 2 and 4). ...The axon usually originates with a rather thick initial segment, directly from the pericaryon (13/15) or from a proximal dendrite. The axonal stem can either directly ascend into the molecular layer where it ramifies (Figs. 1, 4), or it may first engage in a descending course (Fig. 2), giving off several thick collaterals which, after making a hairpin turn, re-ascend towards the molecular layer in which they branch. Before reaching the molecular layer, these collaterals usually give off short beaded fibers ending inside the granular layer (Figs. 1, 2)....The axonal arborization in the molecular layer is quite intricate with rather profuse ramified branches. These fibers have a more or less homogeneous diameter, in the order of 1 micrometer, and exhibit numerous beaded swellings. They are mainly distributed in the inferior two thirds of the layer (Figs. 1 and 2) but, in some cases, may span the entire height of the molecular layer, reaching the pia mater (Fig. 4). ...five of these cells exhibit an axonal collateral which runs for long distances in the supraganglionic plexus, just above the apexes of PC somata. These collaterals follow a transverse direction, parallel to the great axis of the folium, i.e. exactly in the same direction as the parallel fibers. Such a collateral is identical to similar fibers found in Lugaro cell axons (Lugaro, 1894; Fox, 1959; Laine¤ and Axelrad, 1996). Moreover, as in the case of Lugaro cells, this type of long collateral does not seem present in all the globular neurons of our series.,Extending the cerebellar Lugaro cell class,Laine J. & Axelrad H.,Mihail Bota
98,Glu-IR neuron, cerebellar nuclei Batini et al. (Batini),The Glu-IR neurons of the three nuclei included sizes from 10 to 35 (micrometers) with apeak at about 20 (micrometers). This peak was slightly broader than for the GABA-IR and could be considered, morphologically, to be more heterogeneous (Fig. 5B).,Cerebellar nuclei and the nucleocortical projections in the rat: retrograde tracing coupled to GABA snd glutamate immunohistochemistry,Batini C., Compoint C, Buisseret-Delmas C., Daniel H. & Guegan M.,Mihail Bota

100,glutamate/PACAP expressing retinal ganglion cell Hannibal et al. (Hannibal),In the retina PACAP immunoreactivity was located to a homogeneous population of retinal ganglion cells with two to four thin, sparsely branching processes (Fig. 2A). Most processes seemed to radiatel horizontally in the ganglion cell layer towards the optic disc via the optic nerve. Other processes projected through the inner plexiform layer towards the inner nuclear layer in which they seemed to may synaptic contact (Fig. 3A).,PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract,Hannibal J., Moller M., Ottersen O.P. & Fahrenkug J.,Mihail Bota
101,Golgi neuron Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),In 1874 Golgi described two kinds of distinctive large cells in the granular layer of the human cerebellar cortex. The first kind of nerve cell had a long, fusiform perikaryon that lay directly beneath the layer of Purkinje cell bodies and extended transversely across the folium. The second kind that he described was irregularly rounded or polygonal , almost as large as the Purkinje cell, and furnished with nuerous dendrites that, in contrast to those of the fusiform cells, tended predominantly to run into the molecular layer. In the present account we shall follow the traditional terminology and restrict the Golgi cells to the large stellate or polygonal cells that Golgi listed as his second group.,Cerebellar cortex. Cytology and Organization,Palay L.S. & Chan-Palay V.,Mihail Bota
102,Golgi neuron, big Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),In the adult rat two principal kinds of Golgi cells can be distinghuished: large cells lying in the upper half of the granular layer and small cells in the deeper half. Neither cell, however, is absolutely restricted to these locations. The cell bodies that were measured varied from 10.7 micrometers to 23.8 micrometers in maximal dimension and from 9.4 micrometers to 17.9 micrometers in minimal dimension. Golgi cells can display one of two modes of dendritic arborizations. In the first, the dendrites radiate more or less equally from the cell body, while in the second there are one or two main trunks which give off a series of subsidiary branches on their way to the molecular layer. The large cells can have either of these patterns. The large Golgi cells are situated at a little distance below the layer of Purkinje cells, not immedaitely beneath them; that level is occupied by the Lugaro cells and the infraganglionic plexus. Their cell bodies are almost as large as those of the Purkinje cells and could be mistaken for them on account on their rounded shape. But the configuration of the processes emerging from them easily betrays their identity. Each cell has two to four thick dendrites that radiate from the cell body, usually from its upper surface. It is characteristic of the Golgi dendrites that the branches first adopt a nearly horizontal course as they leave the bifurcations and then turn toward the surface of the folium. Probably the most distinctive feature of the Golgi cells is their axons. From one to three axons extend from the cell body, usually its deeper surface, or from one one of the major dendrites close to the cell body. The axon starts out as a fairly straight, smooth and thin process. It can describe a bend or two, and then a short distance from its origin, without any perceptible tapering, it branches dichotomously at right angles. The axons divide again and gain, each branch always projecting straight out at right angles from the stem, and then, after a sharp bend or a gentle curve or two, dividing once more. Both large and small Golgi cells have a peculiar, irregularly corrugated surface, which gives them an unusually ruffled profile in the electron microscopy. In the regions where a mossy fiber rosette or a climbing fiber abuts against the soma, the corrugated surface bears a further series of small, uneven ridges and furrows. Because this part of the cell resembles a Spanish chestnut (Fig. 108)., the articulation found here between the expanded axon terminal and the soma of the Golgi cell has been termed synapse en marron (Chan-Palay and Palay 1971a and b).,Cerebellar cortex. Cytology and Organization,Palay L.S. & Chan-Palay V.,Mihail Bota
103,Golgi neuron, small Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),In the adult rat two principal kinds of Golgi cells can be distinghuished: large cells lying in the upper half of the granular layer and small cells in the deeper half. Neither cell, however, is absolutely restricted to these locations. In its overall form and in the configuration of its processes the small Golgi cell resembles the large Golgi cell, but it has a smaller cell body and its dendritic tree arises from several more or less equal trunks radiating outward from the cell body and branching only a few times (Fig. 87). In the regions where a mossy fiber rosette or a climbing fiber abuts against the soma, the corrugated surface bears a further series of small, uneven ridges and furrows. Because this part of the cell resembles a Spanish chestnut (Fig. 108), the articulation found here between the expanded axon terminal and the soma of the Golgi cell has been termed synapse en marron (Chan-Palay and Palay 1971a and b).,Cerebellar cortex.

104,green-sensitive cone Szel and Rohlich (SR),The presence of the 510 nm peak photopic sensitivity (Neitz and Jacobs, 1986) is strong evidence that the COS-1 positive cones represent the green-sensitive cone subpopulation. This conclusion is supported by our earlier observations that mAb COS- 1 is specific to the middle-to-long wavelength sensitive cones in the mammalian species (Szel et al.. 1988). The middle-to-long wavelength sensitive cones made up the majority (90-97.5%) of cones in all mammalian retinas-similar to the rat, where this ratio was shown to be 9 3 ‘% on average.,Two cone types of rat retina detected by anti-visual pigment antibodies,Szel A. & Rohlich P.,Mihail Bota
105,heterodendritic neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),As with FNs, HNs give rise to long (350–500 micrometers), slender dendritic fields that may traverse the entire Ov. These neurons are located in similar proportions in the nuclear shell (41%) or in the core (59%). Somata of HNs are triangular, rounded, or spindle shaped, in order of frequency, measuring from 18 to 28 micrometers in the longest axis. As a rule, HNs possess long primary dendrites that terminate in second-order branches. These processes are covered by a moderate number of dendritic spines whose stems are uneven in length. HNs share at least three of the following dendritic characteristics (Fig. 12B,C): 1) they give rise to two or three long primary dendrites (>150 micrometers); 2) shafts have an uneven diameter; 3) shafts exhibit large, elliptical swellings devoid of spines; 4) first- and/or second-order branches are bent at an acute angle (i.e., “broken” dendrites; Fig. 12B, neurons a and b); and 5) primary or secondary dendrites give rise to a long appendage made up of successive varicosities devoid of spines.... The axon of HNs arises from the soma, then follows a straight trajectory, providing one or two collaterals to the neuropil of the Ov. Then, it runs ventrally, dorsally, or anteriorly. Axons running anteriorly appear to terminate in the neuropil of the anterolateral area or in the lateral septal nucleus.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

106,horizontal cell Peichl (Peichl),Lucifer-Yellow injections in rat and gerbil retinae revelead only one type of horizontal cell, which resembles the B-type cells of cat and rabbit (Figs 5 and 6). They have a relatively densely branched, approximatively circular dendritic tree with several fine-primary dendrites. The dendrites carry single terminals or small aggregates of terminals which are all in the same place and thus presumably contac cones. On all-well filled individuals an axon is found. Axons commonly originate at a dendrite, are up to 300 micrometers long, and expand into profusely branched axon terminal systems which are densely covered with terminals. These terminals end on various planes and thus presumably contact rods. Horizontal cell soma diameters are 11-14 micrometers in rat.,Immunocytochemical identification of cone bipolar cells in the rat retina,Euler T & Wasle H,Mihail Bota
107,horizontal cell Langer (Langer-SC),By definition, horizontal cells have dendrites which run tangential to or parallel with the surface of the colliculus. Most horizontal cells have fusiform cell bodies, about 10 micrometers in diameter, lying within 250 micrometers of the surface, that is, within the zone of horizontal cells. Their dendrites are usually confined to the same zone (e.g., figs. 5, 6). A few larger cells with extensive horizontal dendrites are found in the zone of optic axons; but since this group has not been observed often, it cannot be categorized satisfactorily. In the subsequent description, unless otherwise specified, “horizontal cell” will refer to this superficial horizontal cell as opposed to the deep horizontal cell. When studied in tangential sections (fig. l), the dendritic field is usually oval in shape (in some cases greater than 1000 micrometers in the long axis) and shallow (usually less than 200 micrometers thick). The horizontal spread of the short axis is 100-1000 micrometers. In general, there are two primary dendrites arising from opposite sides of the cell body which run for 10-50 micrometers before branching into much longer, higher order dendrites. The dendrites of horizontal cells have few protrusions (spines, knobs, clubs, gemmules). The density of spines is one of the lowest for cells of the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. There is some variability in the density of spines from one horizontal cell to another, but they are never as numerous as for spiny marginal or piriform cells. The spines that do occur are more often in clusters (fig. 8)... The axon arises from the cell body, a primary dendrite, or in some cases from a higher order dendrite. It runs an irregular course and branches profusely within the zone of horizontal cells where it has a distribution similar to that of the dendritic field (fig. 9). Like many of the other intrinsic axons it has many en passant varicosities and terminal swellings. While the dendrites of most horizontal cells are restricted to the zone of horizontal cells, some cells have been seen that have dendrites that descend through the first two zones to give horizontal branches running at several levels throughout the stratum griseum superficiale for great horizontal distances, comparable to those seen in horizontal cells (fig. 7). These cells impregnate seldom, therefore it is difficult to determine whether they are a separate cell type or an extreme example of the horizontal cell type.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota

110,indoleamine-accumulating amacrine cell type 1 Matsumoto et al. (M),Type I cells had large and ovoid shaped cell bodies (18.8 ± 2.5 X 15.5 ± 1.8 micrometers in mean diameter) with 2 to 4 primary processes (Fig. 1b). These cells showed the highest immunostaining among 5 types. The cells boies were located in the inner lamina of the inner nuclear layer (INL), especially in its innermost lamina (Fig. 1c). The primary processes were rather thin and had various size of varicosities. Most of their processes lay in the boundary between the INL and inner plexiform layer (IPL). A small number of the processes extended in the middle laminal of the IPL (Fig. 1c). Occasionally, the processes proceeding outward across the INL to the outer plexiform layer (OPL) were observed (Fig. 1d). In the whole retina, the total number of type 1 cells was 771.8 ± 92.8 (mean number in five retinas) and the mean density was 27.2 ± 2.6/mm2 (Table 1). The mean density of these celss in TUp (temporal upper periphery) was the highest among 8 parts. The distribution of type 1 cells was denser in the upper peripheral retina. The mean length of processes was 220 ± 20 micrometers (Table 2).

111,indoleamine-accumulating amacrine cell type 2 Matsumoto et al. (M),Type 2 cells were large (18.3 ± 2.1 X 15.9 ± 1.5 micrometers in diameter) and ovoid shape (Fig. 2a). They were displaced in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) (Figs. 2a, b). The arbores of the processes were intermingled with those of of the type 1 cells in the interface between the INL and IPL. Two kinds of the proxmal processes were distinguished: one is the process left from the outer surface of the cell body and directly ran outward (Fig. 2c), and the ther travelled horizontally in a short distance and gradually proceeded outward. In the whole retina, the total number of this type cells was 23.5 ± 8.8, and the mean density was 0.8 ± 0.3/mm2 (Table 1).

112,indoleamine-accumulating amacrine cell type 3 Matsumoto et al. (M),Type 3 cells were large (18.4 ± 3.0 X 15.1 ± 1.7 micrometers in diameter) and ovoid in shape, and the cell bodies were displaced in the IPL (Fig. 2d). The proximal processes ran horizontally within the IPL, and the peripheral processes extended in the same plane as those of the tpye 2 cells. The number of this type was very small.,Morphological characterization and distribution of indoleamine-accumulating cells in the rat retina,Matsumoto Y., Ueda S. & Kawata M.,Mihail Bota
113,indoleamine-accumulating amacrine cell type 4 Matsumoto et al. (M),The type 4 cells were small (11.7 ± 2.0 9.5 ± 1.6 micrometers in diameter) sized and of round shape (Fig. 2e). The majority of these cells possessed 2 or 3 fine processes and cells without having any processes were often found in the flat-mount view. The cell bodies of this type were located in the inner lamina of the INL. The arbors of the processes lay in the same planes as of the type 2 cells. In the whole retina, the total number of this type was 132.5 ± 16.4, and the mean density was 4.6 ± 0.6/mm2 (Table 1). The distribution density of these cells was higher in the central retina than in the peripheral retina.,Morphological characterization and distribution of indoleamine-accumulating cells in the rat retina,Matsumoto Y., Ueda S. & Kawata M.,Mihail Bota
114,indoleamine-accumulating amacrine cell type 5 Matsumoto et al. (M),Type 5 cells had small and round cell bodies (11.5 ± 2.3 X 9.5 ± 2.1 micrometers in diameter) similar to the type 4 cells, but they were located in the GCL. Their processes were hardly seen in the retinal flat-mounts, whereas the processes proceeding outward across the IPL were clearly shown in the transverse sections (Fig. 2f).,Morphological characterization and distribution of indoleamine-accumulating cells in the rat retina,Matsumoto Y., Ueda S. & Kawata M.,Mihail Bota
115,inner alpha retinal ganglion cell Peichl (Peichl),Rat alpha cell dendritic trees. like those of all mammalian alpha cells, are monostratified in the IPL in either an inner sublamina (inner alpha cell) or an outer sublamina (outer alpha cell). Dendrites of inner alpha cells branch most frequently in the distal dendritic field; near the soma there are dendrite-free zone.,Alpha and delta ganglion cells in the rat retina,Peichl L.,Mihail Bota
116,inner alpha retinal ganglion cell Tauchi (Tauchi),Figure 2A depicts photomicrograph of dendritic morphologies of a pair of Lucifer-injected large ganglion cells. The right hand cell has a polygonal soma like the ones shown in Fig. 1, and a morphology typical of alpha cells in having 5-6 primary dendrites which branch out out simmetrically, together with a thick axon (Boycott and Wassle 1974; Amthor et al. 1983; Peichl et al. 1987a and 1987b). Similarly, most of the dye-injected cells having a large polygonal soma more than 20 micrometers in diameter were identified as typical alpha cells. The dendrites of all these cells were found ramifying in the inner part of the IPL, namely in sublamina b. We will therefore refer to them as inner alpha cells (Peichl 1989).,Morphological comparisons between outer and inner ramifying alpha cells of the albino rat retina,Tauchi M., Morigiwa K. & Fukuda Y.,Mihail Bota

118,intermediate vertical fusiform cell Langer (Langer-SC),The intermediate vertical fusiform cells have cell bodies 12-18 micrometers in diameter in the upper portion of the zone of vertical cells and their dendritic fields extend from the collicular surface to the deep margin of the zone of vertical cells (fig. 12b, 13). Intermediate vertical fusiform cells most often have a superficial field with relatively fewer spines, straighter, more even caliber dendrites that branch less often but more equally than those in the deep field of the same cell (figs. 12b, 13).,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
119,intermediate-conducting retinal ganglion cell Fukuda-physiological (F-physio),Further support for the three-group classification of ganglion cells was gained by physiological measurements of conduction velocities of ganglion cell axons. By recording axonal or cellular discharges in the retina values of 16.8 ± 1.5, 11.4 ± 1.0 and 6.3 ± 1.1 m/sec were obtained as the average velocities of the fast, intermediate and slow conducting axons.

121,interplexiform cell Perry (Perry),We...observed cells in vertical sections where a process arises from the cell body and ascends through the inner nuclear layer to terminate in the outer plexiform layer (figure 2, plate 1; figure 10).

122,inverted pyramidal cell Langer (Langer-SC),One other cell type within the definition of the narrow field vertical cells is what iscalled an inverted pyramidal cell. They are similar to pyramidal cells except that the cell body lies within the deep portion of the zone of horizontal cells. The superficial field is a circumsomatic field and the deep field is elongated to reach into the deeper portion of the zone of vertical cells. The cell body is about the size of an intermediate vertical fusiform cell soma. The axon is similar, but more apt to have collaterals to the superficial zones.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota

The product of the long and short diameters of the labeled neurons was less than 270 micrometers2, with the majority measuring about 150 micrometers2, and, therefore, these were categorized as 'small' neurons. Most of the labeled neurons were located contralateral to the injection site, and only a few were observed on the ipsilateral side (Figs. 1 A, 2A, B).,The GABAergic cerebello-olivary projection in the rat,Fredette B.J. & Mugnaini E.,Mihail Bota

125,large basket cell SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),In the neocortex, large basket cells (LBC)s are generally large, aspiny multipolar neurons that place about 20�40% of their synapses on target cell somata (Somogyi et al, 1983; Kisvarday, 1992). Their axons usually originate from the pial aspect of the soma, and typically ascend to give rise to many long horizontally and vertically projecting axon collaterals that traverse neighboring columns and can extend through all cortical layers. Smaller side branches terminate in pericellular baskets around somata and proximal dendrites of neurons (Somogyi et al, 1983; Jones and Hendry, 1984; Kisvarday, 1992).,Anatomical, physiological, molecular and circuit properties of nest basket cells in the developing somatosensory cortex,Wang Y., Gupta A., Toledo-Rodriguez M., Wu C.Z. & Markram H.,Mihail Bota
126,large CCk-ir neuron Ju et al.

128,large ganglion cell Reese and Cowey (RC),The present study considered the possibility that one particular and relatively rare retinal ganglion cell type may have its peak density on or near the representation of the vertical midline and may display a laterality of projection delineated by that midline representation. ...We consider the variability in Type I cell morphology as a means for exclusively classing every large retinal ganglion cell in the rat.

130,large THI-DA retinal cell Versaux-Boteri et al (VB),Only one type of DA-positive cell could be observed. They were very large amacrine neurons that sent opposite dendrites to the outermost sublayer of the IPL )Fig. 7, 9, 10). A number of interplexiform cells (Figs. 9, 10) as well as some displaced amcrines in the ganglion cell layer could be observed among the DA-positive neurons. In flatmounts, the DA-positive cells exhibited a stellate shape (Fig. 8).,Regional specialization of the rat retina: catecholamine-containing amacrine cell characterization and distribution,Versaux-Botteri C., Martin-Martinelli E., Nguyen-LeGros J., Geffard M., Vigny A. & Denoroy L.,Mihail Bota
131,LHA-projecting retinal ganglion cell Moore (Moore),...FluoroGold injections restricted to the LHA (n = 7) label a small population of cells found almost exclusively in one quadrant of the retina (Fig. 2). Although there is some variability in fiducial mark placementsm this appears to be the superior temporal quadrant of the retina. The size and morphology of these cells are consistent with the type III classification of Perry [24]. They have one to four thin radiating dendrites (Fig. 3A and B) which can be followed only for short distances, usually not more than a few cell diameters. Within these limits, the dendrites appaear to give off few branches. Retinas ipsilateral to LHA injections contain only a few labeled cells. The ipsilateral cells have a similar distribution and morphology. ...a homogenous population of cells with a mean area of 92.3 ± 23.3 micromenters2 and a mean diameter of 12.6 ± 1.6 micrometers.,Identification of retinal ganglion cells projecting to the lateral hypothalamic area of the rat,Leak R.H. & Moore R.Y.,Mihail Bota

134,Lugaro neuron Laine and Axelrad (LA),[...] Lugaro cells, which are found in all parts of the cerebellum [...] must therefore be considered as a distinct cell class: (1) they are nearly always located at the upper border of the granular layer, just beneath the monolayer of Purkinje cell somata, only very few neurons being scattered in the depth of the granular layer; (2) they have a bipolar fusiform shape, the soma being elongated in a parasagittal direction from which the long dendrites radiate in a diverging manner, extending in a flattened horizontal X underneath the ganglionic layer; and (3) their axon projects into the molecular layer with a constant profuse local plexus and some apparently inconstant distal fibers, while a few sparse projections to the granular layer are also systematically found.,Morphology of the Golgi-impregnated Lugaro cell in the rat cerebellar cortex: a reappraisal with a description of its axon,Laine J. & Axelrad H.,Mihail Bota

One can take 11.5 micrometers as being the boundary between S- and M- cells (S-M) boundary and 14.5 micrometers as that between M- and L-cells (M-L boundary).

136,marginal cell Langer (Langer-SC),The marginal cells are the most superficially located and the smallest cells of the superior colliculus. Their 5-8 micrometers wide, ovoid cell bodies are interspersed among or just beneath the anteroposterior coursing fibers of the stratum zonale. They project one to five, but most commonly two, dendrites from the deeper portions of the cell body surface. These branch several times to form a dense arbor of dendritic processes that extend as much as 150 micrometers subjacent to the cell body and may radiate as much as 75 micrometers lateral to the cell body. The axon of a marginal cell resembles other local axons in that it has an extensive local distribution, has a fine caliber, and many branches, but no over-all direction (fig. 9). There are both en passant and terminal varicosities, suggesting both types of synaptic contact. Our material did not show any marginal cell axon extending below the zone of horizontal cells.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
137,Martinotti neuron SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),This neuron class was first identified by Martinotti (Martinotti, 1889), and first named by Cajal (Cajal, 1891). The essential criteria [to identify a Martinotti cell] were: (a) axonal projections with a horizontal spread in layer I that typically extended beyond a column radius (150 �m) (see Fig. 1A), and (b) axonal collaterals decorated with spiny boutons (Fig. 1C). Additionally, [Martinotti cells] MCs often presented more spines on their dendrites than other types of interneurones at this stage of development...Most MC somata were ovoid or spindle shaped (94%), whereas others could have a pyramidal, round or multipolar form. MC somata usually gave rise to vertically oriented bundles of two to four primary dendrites from opposite somatic poles (bitufted dendritic morphology, 89%), with one of the primary dendrites branching more frequencly and descending to the deeper layers (72%, Fig. 3). Typically, MC dendrites were beaded (96%) and more spines with sparse to medium density (86%). MC dendrites often branched frequently giving rise to the most elaborate dendritic tress of all the interneurones at this stage of neocortical development. MC axons often emerged from the 1st or 2nd branch order of a dendrite (81%) and in a few cases (8%), especially in infragranular layers, axons emerged from 3rd or higher dendritic branch orders. The remainder (11%) directly sent axons out from their somata. Axons projected toward the pia where they formed a cluster in layer I from where the long horizontal collaterals emerged spreading over neighbouring columns (horizontal diameter, mean � S.D., 1013 � 503 �m), and in some cases projecting as far as 2365 �m. In addition to the arborization in layer I, MCs also formed a local axonal arborization around their somata. Infragranular MCs formed an additional cluster of axons in layer IV. Axonal collaterals typically branched with large angles (about 80 deg on average) to from the arborization (Table 2). Finally, most MCs also sent a few axonal collaterals down to deeper layers without forming clusters.,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota
138,Martinotti neuron, layer II/III SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),These [Martinotti cells] MCs usually had the most extensive dendritic arbours. Most MCs (91%) projected their dendrites (mainly with a primary prominent dendrite) down to deeper layers, and more than half projected their dendrites as far as infragranular layers (layers V and VI). Their axonal collaterals were distributed mainly in layer I. Most MCs (74%) formed a more dense axonal cluster in layer I while the remainder formed a more dense axonal cluster around their own somata (Fig. 3A1). The clusters in layer I appeared as a secondary peak of 350�370 ?m from the somata in the axon Sholl distance histogram (ASD, reflecting the overall axonal spread, Fig. 3A2). On average, more than half (56%) of the total boutons of a layer II/III MC were distributed in layer I (see Table 2). These data indicate that layer I is the major target for layer II/III MCs.,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota
139,Martinotti neuron, layer II/III c-AC SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),Subclass of Martinotti cells found in layers II/III that have a classical accomodating (habituation) response to a step stimulation. The majority of Martinotti cells in this layer are distributed in this subclass.,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota
140,Martinotti neuron, layer II/III c-NAC SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),Subclass of Martinotti cells found in layers II/III that have a classical non-accomodating (constant frecquency) response to a step stimulation.,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota

142,Martinotti neuron, layer IV SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),The dendritic distribution of layer IV [Martinotti cells] MCs tended to be localized more within layer IV (43% with dendrites confined to layer IV; Fig. 3B1). The remainder of the MCs projected a few dendritic branches into neighbouring layers, but rarely further. Their dendritic trees were smaller than those of layers II/III and V MCs, presenting significantly shorter average lengths of dendritic trees (ALDT, P < 0.05, Table 2), shorter vertically spreading dendritic arbours (P < 0.05, Table 2), and smaller dendritic spread distance (DSD, reflects the overall dendritic spread, P < 0.05, Table 2). Their axon distribution also tended to be mostly restricted to their layer. They typically formed a prominent local axonal cluster around their somata (89% of layer IV MCs), sending only a few collaterals up to layer I which formed a sparse arborization, with a few horizontally projecting axons. Only a single peak close to the soma is therefore present in the ASD histogram (Fig. 3B2). Only 18% of the total boutons of layer IV MCs are distributed in layer I, which was significantly lower than both layer II/III (P < 0.01) and layer V MCs (P < 0.05; Table 2). Layer IV MCs generally also tended to present lower axonal branch orders (ABO), and smaller total axonal lengths compared with layer II/III MCs (Table 2).,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota

146,Martinotti neuron, layer V SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),Most of these [Martinotti cells] MCs formed larger axonal clusters in layer IV and in layer I than around their somata (94% of layer V MCs, Fig. 3C1). On average, most boutons were located in layer IV, but 36% were located in layer I (Table 2), suggesting that layer I is also a major target for layer V MCs. A typical layer V MC therefore presented two secondary peaks in the ASD histogram, one up to 520 ?m away from the soma representing the axonal clusters formed in layer IV and another at about 750�850 ?m away representing the axonal clusters formed in layer I (ASD, Fig. 3C2). Consistent with their deep location, layer V MCs presented a greater number of axonal segments (SEG), larger total axonal lengths, overall axonal spread (ASD), higher branch orders (ABO) and more boutons and than MCs in layer II/III and IV (Table 2).,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota

150,Martinotti neuron, layer VI SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),These [Martinotti cells] MCs were similar to those in layer V (Fig. 3D). Their dendrites mostly extended within infragranular layers. Like layer V MCs, they also formed axonal clusters in both layers IV and I, but more often formed denser axonal clusters around their somata than found for layer V MCs.,Anatomical, phyiosological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells in the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat,Wang Y, Toledo-Rodriguez M, Gupta A, Wu C., Silberberg G., Luo J., Markram H.,Mihail Bota

152,melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cell Berson, Hattar et al (BH),Somatic immunoreactivity appeared mainly at the cell surface (Fig. 1B1), suggestive of melanopsin being targeted to the plasma membrane. Every labeled retinal cell was a ganglion cell, on the basis of the presence of an axon coursing into the optic fiber layer and toward the optic disc. More than 95% of labeled cell bodies were in ganglion cell layer, the remainder being dispalced to the inner nuclear layer. Dendrites from adjacent cells overlapped extensively, forming a reticular network (Fig. 1B2). The stained dendrites and proximal axons had a beaded appearance, showing punctate, dense labeling. The complete dendritic fields of labeled cells, visualized from stacked confocal images (e.g., Fig. 1B2). had varied sizes and shapes (Fig. 1C). Labeled displaced RGCs (Fig. 1C, right three cells) had similar soma sizes but less extensive dendritic arborizations than nondispalced cells (Fig. 1C, left three cells). The mean somatic diameter of labeld non-displaced RGCs was 16 micrometers (Fig 1.D), but the limited sample of dendritic-field measurements precluded any statistics. Morphologically, these neurons fit within the type III group of rat RGCs (17), especially tyose shown to be intrinsically photosensitive (12). ...Whether in the ganglion cell layer (Fig. 2A) or displaced to the inner nuclear layer (Fig. 2B), the melanopsin-expressing RGCs extended dendrites into the inner plexiform layer, where they arborized most extensively at the border with the inner nuclear layer.,Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells: architecture, porjections, and intrinsic photosensitivity,Hattar S., Liao H.-W., Takao M., Berson D.M. & Yau K.-W.,Mihail Bota
153,modified pyramidal neuron SSp-layer IV-morphology, general (W.),Modified pyramidal neurons were characterized by the presence of an apical dendrite that projected superficially and gave rise to densely spined �daughter segments� (Simons and Woolsey, 1984).The remainder of the dendrites of modified pyramidal cells projected radially in all directions. Modified pyramidal cells and multipolar cells had at least three primary dendritic processes issuing from the soma. The overall number of dendrites found on these cells varied, as did the overall dendritic pattern. Modified pyramidal neurons have been described in both the rat (star pyramid; Simons and Woolsey, 1984) and the mouse (modified pyramidal cell; White, 1978).,Neuronal composition and morphology in layer IV of two vibrissal barrel subfields of rat cortex,Elston G.N., Pow D.V. & Calford M.B.,Mihail Bota

163,motor neuroendocrine parvicellular SOM neuron Swanson (Swanson),Neurosecretory somatostatin cell bodies are generally small and fusiform, and are centered in a characteristic regions of the periventricular zone between the suprachiasmatic nucleus rostrally and the rostral tip of the ventromedial nucleus caudally (Fig. 16A). This cell group stretches throughout the vertical extent of the anterior periventricular nucleus and dorsally extends into the parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus (Dierickx and Vandensade 1979), which contain at least 750 somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons (Sawchenko and Swanson 1982b).,The hypothalamus, Handbook of chemical neuroanatomy,Swanson L.W.,Mihail Bota
164,motor neuroendocrine parvicellular TRH neuron Swanson (Swanson),Many TRH-positive neurons were seen in the parvocellular part of the nucleus, mainly in the anterior and medial parvocellular part (Fig. 8F). No positive cells were found in the lateral parvocellular part nor in the magnocellular division. Only single TRH cells in the periventricular part have so far been found to be positive for both CRF and NT (fig 8H, I, J, 10C).

168,MTN-projecting retinal ganglion cell Dann (Dann),All cells labelled with HRP after injection into the MTN were of uniform medium size and, without exception, were confined to the retinal ganglion cell layer. ... Cells projecting to the MTN were characterised by extensively, most dichotomously, branched dendrites which had a beaded appearance and very thin intersections (Fig. 10A-D). In the rat, unlike the cells projecting to the MTN in the rabbit (Bull and Peichl, 1986), there was no pronounced difference in the appearance of ganglion cells that projected to the MTN from superior (Fig. 10B, C), as opposed to inferior (Fig. 10A, D) retina. From either retinal location,cells had simlar dendritic branching patterns and density of branching. Somas were approximately centrally located in most cells; however, in some instances the cell body was placed peripherally in the field. There was some variation in soma and dendritic field area, which apparently reflects some degree of individual variation between cells, since no consistent pattern of variation with eccentricity could be found for rat. Throughout the entire rat retina, irrespective of retinal location, the morphology of ganglion cells projecting to the MTN was essentially the same (Fig. 11).,Retinal ganglion cells projecting to the accessory optic system in the rat,Dann J.F. & Buhl E.H.,Mihail Bota

170,multipolar Lugaro cell Geurts et al. (G),Detailed morphological analysis has recently revealed that these cells project their axon into the molecular layer, where it displays an arborization pattern reminiscent of that of Lugaro cells. Furthermore, their cell body and dendrites are contacted by Purkinje cell collaterals, a feature characteristic of Lugaro cells. Consequently, these cells represent a class of neuronal cells in the granular layer that does not fit the current classification. To designate these cells, and to differentiate them from Golgi cells and classical bipolar Lugaro cells, we propose the term 'multipolar Lugaro cell'.,Unravelling the cerebellar cortex: cytology and cellular physiology of large-sized interneurons in the granular layer,Geurts F.J., de Schutter E. & Dieudonne S.,Mihail Bota
171,narrow field vertical cell Langer (Langer-SC),Narrow field vertical cells are a SC class of cells which include vertical fusiform cells, pyramidal cells and inverted pyramidal cells. They are distributed across several of the SC layers (see Table 1, page 407). For morphological details, see the definitions of subclasses and types of this class. Collator note: we assumed this class of neurons as projection neurons, because at least several subpopulations project to visually related areas.

172,narrow-field bistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),We have observed cells in vertical sections with the same morphology as the bistratified rod amacrine cells described by Famiglietti & Kolb (1975) in the cat retina. A similar cell type has been described by Cajal (1893) in a number of mammls and by Boycott & Dowling (1969) in the primate retina, but all these authors called the cell a narrow-field diffuse cell. Famiglietti & Kolb (1975) have shown that this cell is bistratified with respect of its synaptic connections. Our cells have a mean soma size of 9.0 micrometers (range 8.5-10 micrometers; N = 16). A single large dendrite arises from the cell and apsses a short way into the inner plexiform layer before branching into two more dendrites (see figure 6, plate 2, and figure 16). When viewed in vertical sections the dendrites form a cone in the inner plexiform layer, with the boradest extent at hte level of the ganglion cell. At their broadest extend the dendritic fields are 30 micrometers in diameter (range 20-40 micrometer; N = 16). These cells have large knobs on the cell soma and proximal dendrites, and the knobs of the dendritic tree in the inner part of the inner plexiform layer are smaller. The large proximal knobs have been identified as presynaptic to ganglion cells in the cat retina, while the inner dendrites are postsynaptic to the rod bipolar cells (Famiglietti & Kolb 1975).,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
173,nest basket cell SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),This class of interneuron seems to be a hybrid of [small basket cells] SBCs and [basket cells] BCs, because they exhibit a local nest of axons around the somata and long extending axons. Like BCs and SBCs, they form synapses on somata (at least 16%) and exhibit similar axonal branch angles (68.9 � 5.4 ?m; n = 7). They differ from BCs in their [axon Scholl distance] ASD (less than half the value, 99.1 � 21.4 ?m) and from SBCs in their [axonal segment length] ASL (nearly 50% longer, 47.5 � 10.2 ?m).

177,neurogliaform Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),Neurogliaform (NG) neurons are rather rare (Jones, 1984), distinct cells observed in dorsal regions of the Ju, and they constitute the first type of interneuron. In the Ju, NG neurons bear small, round or star-shaped somata (Fig. 3B), measuring from 18 to 22 micrometers in diameter. The soma gives rise to five to eight primary dendrites extending radially. Occasionally, primary dendrites may ramify into short secondary, usually terminal branches. Each dendritic shaft displays distinct varicosities and, as a rule, is devoid of spines. The dendritic field is nearly spherical. The axon leaves from the soma or from a proximal dendrite and soon divides repeatedly, originating a rather dense plexus made up of thin, intertwined branches. The field occupied by this cloud-like framework measuring 200–300 micrometers overlaps the neuron’s own dendritic field and surrounds dendritic processes from bipolar and small pyramidal neurons (Table 2).,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota
177,neurogliaform Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The soma of NG is oval to pear-shaped, measuring about 18 micrometers in the longest axis (Fig. 10C). Six to nine primary dendrites leave the soma in a radial fashion, and, although in general most of these primary branches do not ramify, two or three secondary branches are found. Dendrites are varicose and virtually devoid of spines. The dendritic field of NG is nearly circular and, as a rule, smaller than the area covered by the axonal field. The NG axon exhibits four distinctive features. First, the site of origin, which is difficult to visualize, is at the root of a primary dendrite. Second, it ramifies repeatedly into short, arched collaterals, which, in turn, ramify successively. Third, this pattern of axonal ramification brings about a dense axonal framework resembling a spiderweb (Jones, 1984). Finally, the axon and its collaterals frequently exhibit large (0.3– 0.5 micrometers), beaded structures. The resulting axonal cloud measures from 150 to 200 micrometers. Immersed within this axonal framework are somata and dendritic processes from adjacent neurons of the core (Table 2).,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

179,non-bursting LTS neuron Hoffman et al. (HTD),Another PVN neuronal population was composed of non-bursting LTS cells; these conformed with type-II electrophysiological criteria (Tasker and Dudek, '91) by having relatively small low-threshold potentials that usually generated only one or two action potentials (Fig. 3A). Also consistent with this classification, non-bursting LTS cells were more heterogeneous in their electrophysiological properties than the other two cell types. Thus non-bursting LTS neurons displayed I-V relations that were linear or weakly nonlinear (Fig. 3B). Of nine non-bursting LTS neurons recorded in this study, none stained positively for neurophysin (Fig. 4).

180,non-LTS neuron Hoffman et al. (HTD),Non-LTS neurons conformed to the previous type-I classification (Tasker and Dudek, '91), since they lacked low-threshold potentials, had linear I-V relations and showed evidence for a pronounced A current (Fig. 1). Four of five non-LTS neurons, all situated in the PVN, were immunoreactive for neurophysin (Fig. 2). Two neurons with type-I electrophysiological characteristics were also recorded in the SON. One of these cells was histochemically processed and found to be neurophysin positive.

182,NPY-immunoreactive amacrine cell Oh et al. (Oh),In the INL, the most frequently observed immunostained cells were characterized by a small, round cell body located in the innermost row of the INL, adjacent to the IPL. These cells had multiple fine processes that were narrowly distributed instratum 1 of the IPL and these processes appeared to be confined in this stratum (Figs. 1A, 3A). The mean somal diameter of NPY-immunoreactive amacrine cells was 8.8 & plusmn; 1.6 micrometers (SD) in the central retina and 9.6 & plusmn 1.2 micrometers in the peripheral retina....In the INL, the maximum density of NPY-immunoreactive amacrine cells was 437.5 & plusmn; 32.1 cells/mm2 (SD) in the retinal region temporal to the optic disc. Cell density decreased toward the peripheral retina, with densities of 119.4 & plusmn; 18.3 cells/mm2 in the nasal and temporal periphery and 200 to 400 (234.6 & plusmn; 24.3 to 347.5 & plusmn; 34.7) cells/mm2 elsewhere in the retina (Fig. 6, Top).,Distribution and synaptic connectivity of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive amacrine cell in the rat retina,Oh S.-J., D'Angelo I., Lee E.-J., Chun M.-H., Brecha N.C.,Mihail Bota

185,OFF cone bipolar cell Hartveit (H),For the types CB1, CB2, CB3, and CB4, kainate (or AMPA) evoked a short-latency inward current, characteristic of a direct response, in every cell tested. In addition, for a number of cells there was evidence that kainate evoked an indirect response mediated by GABAergic input onto the axon terminals of these cells. This was observed as a gradual drift of the Erev from ~0 mV toward ECl during longer-lasting application of kainate. Indeed, with perfect voltage clamp, the observed I-V curve would simply be the linear sum of the I-V curves for the two response components (direct and indirect). This drift of Erev was blocked when kainate was coapplied with the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the GABAC receptor antagonist 3-APMPA, and it was not observed in axotomized bipolar cells. In both of these conditions the evoked current reversed close to 0 mV, as expected for nonselective cation channels integral to ionotropic glutamate receptors. Furthermore, no cells classified as CB1-CB4 ever responded to kainate with an outward current at -70 mV, the response expected for an APB type of glutamate receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the cone bipolar cells morphologically classified as CB1-CB4 correspond physiologically to OFF cone bipolar cells, expressing conventional ionotropic non-NMDA glutamate receptors.,Functional organization of cone bipolar cells in the rat retina,Hartveit E.,Mihail Bota
186,off-center retinal ganglion cell Brown-physiological (B-physio),If the rate of firing of the cell was decreased, the cell was classified as off-center. Responses from an off-center cell are shown in Figs 4 and 9. This units responded to both the on and off of a background light. It also had a demonstrable antagonistic surround, which was more efficacious and larger in brighter background illumination.,Rat retinal ganglion cells: receptive field organization and maintained activity,Brown JE, Rojas A.J,Mihail Bota
187,ON cone bipolar cell Hartveit (H),For many cells of types CB5-CB9, kainate did not evoke a short-latency response, but indirectly mediated responses were sometimes observed during longer-lasting application of kainate. These indirect responses were slow in onset, reversed close to and followed changes in ECl, and could be blocked by a combination of picrotoxin and 3-APMPA. These characteristics were identical to those described above for OFF cone bipolar cells and to those observed previously for rod bipolar cells (Hartveit 1996b). In addition, a few cells responded to kainate with an outward current at -70 mV, typical for APB-like responses. On the basis of these results, one would expect that CB5-CB9do not express functional (conductance increasing) ionotropic glutamate receptors and therefore would correspond physiologically to ON cone bipolar cells.,Functional organization of cone bipolar cells in the rat retina,Hartveit E.,Mihail Bota

189,OP-projecting retinal ganglion cell Young and Lund (YL),Following unilateral OPN injections, labelled cells could be detected in both the ipsilateral and contralateral retinae. in the contralateral retina, the majority of Fluoro-Gold labeled cells were seen in the ventral hemiretina, inferior to the horizontal meridian. The majority of the remaining labeled cells were found in the nasal retinal quadrant, mostly in the peripheral and ventral portion of this quadrant. The diameter of labeled RGCs rangted from 7 micrometers to 25 micrometers. There appears to be two distinct populations of cells labeled, with the majority of cells in the smaller diameter group having the diameters ranging from 10-13 micrometers, and a less populous group of larger cells having diameters of 20-25 micrometers.,The retinal ganglion cells that drive pupilloconstrictor response in rats,Young M.J. & Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
190,OS2-positive cone Szel and Rohlich (SR),Three photoreceptor cell types can be distinguished in retinal sections from rat eyes: OS-2 positive cones, COS-1 positive cones and anti-rhodopsin positive rods (Fig. 1). The overwhelming majority of photoreceptor cells were recognized by AO, a polyclonal antibody raised against bovine opsin, and can unequivocally be considered to be rods [Fig. 1(C)]. Cells labelled with either COS-1 or OS-2, monoclonal antibodies to cone visual pigments in mammals, can be taken as cones [Figs 2(A) and (B)]. The mutual complementarity of the labelling with the three antibodies further supports their cone-like nature.,Two cone types of rat retina detected by anti-visual pigment antibodies,Szel A. & Rohlich P.,Mihail Bota
191,outer alpha retinal ganglion cell Peichl (Peichl),Rat alpha cell dendritic trees. like those of all mammalian alpha cells, are monostratified in the IPL in either an inner sublamina (inner alpha cell) or an outer sublamina (outer alpha cell).The dendrites of outer alpha cells show frequent branching also near the soma so that their dendritic field is more homogeneously filled with processes.,Alpha and delta ganglion cells in the rat retina,Peichl L.,Mihail Bota
192,outer alpha retinal ganglion cell Tauchi (Tauchi),The cell illustrated at the left side of Fig. 2A had a somewhat smaller, oval or spherical soma and revelead dendrites arborizing at a levels more distal than that of inner cells, in the outer lamina of the IPL (sublamina a). Despite their spherical soma, their dendritic branchings are still characteristic of alpha cells. We therefore call these cells outer alpha cells.,Morphological comparisons between outer and inner ramifying alpha cells of the albino rat retina,Tauchi M., Morigiwa K. & Fukuda Y.,Mihail Bota

196,Pericommissural type I neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),A first type of PC consists of a neuron having a nearly spherical soma from which two dendrites or sets of two or three branches emerge (Fig. 15, neurons a–c). Dendrites exhibit distinct rounded varicosities and are devoid of spines. The axon curves and ramifies repeatedly, acquiring a beaded appearance. Thus, the axon and its collaterals provide an overall acinar picture. The ensuing axonal framework surrounds unstained pericommissural somata and, dorsally, gains access to the ventral part of the Ov shell.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

197,Pericommissural type II neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),A second type of PC cell consists of a bipolar neuron whose dendritic field covers the dorsal or caudal aspect of the AC (Fig. 15, neuron d). The somata are elliptical and give rise to paired, usually unbranched dendrites devoid of spines with discreet varicosities. These neurons issue long ascending axons that run parallel to those from the StT, between the anterior and the posterior divisions of the BST. Along its way, the parent axon provides collaterals to the neuropil of the Ov, interfascicular, and/or triangular nuclei.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

199,photosensitive SCN-projecting retinal ganglion cell Berson, Hattar et al (BH),In isolated retinas, whole-cell recordings were made of the responses of labeled ganglion cells to light (10) (Fig. 1, A to E). In most of these cells (n = 150), light evoked large depolarizations with superimposed fast action potentials (Fig. 1, E to G) (11). Photosensitive ganglion cells shared a common morphology (Fig. 4, A and B), as revealed by intracellular staining with LY (28). Somata were intermediate in diameter among neurons of the ganglion cell layer (14.7 ± 1.2 micrometers,mean 6 SD; n= 18). Many cells sent an axon into the optic fiber layer; those lacking one had presumably lost it during mechanical exposure of the soma before recording. The sparsely branching, tortuous dendrites of these cells arborized primarily in the outer part (OFF sublayer) of the inner plexiform layer (IPL; Fig. 4B). Although some dendrites coursed within the inner IPL (ON sublayer) for 100 to 200 micrometers, nearly all terminated in the OFF sublayer. Such stratification is highly unusual for ganglion cells depolarized by light [but see (29, 30)]. Dendritic fields were large (diameter 497 ± 115 micrometers; mean ± SD; n = 21). Stimuli illuminating the dendrites but not the soma consistently evoked light responses (31).,Phototransduction by retinal ganglion cells that set the circadian clock,Berson D.M., Dunn F.A. & Motoharu Takao,Mihail Bota
200,piriform cell Langer (Langer-SC),The piriform cells have ovoid or cup shaped cell bodies, 10-15 micrometers in diameter, located within a narrow lamina along the deep margin of the zone of horizontal cells. The restriction of the piriform cell somata to the boundary between the zone of horizontal cells and the zone of vertical cells is remarkably accurate and consistent. The piriform cells give rise to 2-5 dendrites from the superficial surface, which course through the zone of horizontal cells to terminate just beneath the surface. As the ascending dendrites approach the surface they branch more frequently, almost always by equipartition, to form a complicated intermingling bouquet of slowly tapering dendrites, 150-350 micrometers in width and slightly less than 200 micrometers in depth. The axon most frequently takes its origin from the base of the soma, but sometimes it arises from one of the low order dendrites. From its origin the axon runs immediately down through the zone of vertical cells, occasionally with collaterals which may arborize within the superficial laminae. The axon is thin and smooth, occasionally with en passant varicosities.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
201,PNMT-immunoreactive retinal cell Versaux-Boteri et al (VB),Among the retinal fragments treated with anti-PNMT, some contained only a few weakly stained cells while other contained a dense population of heavily labelled small neurons (Fig. 12). Approximatively half the number of somas were observed in the amacrine cell layer and half in the ganglion cell layer. The neurons had a round or slightly pear-shaped soma (7.04 ± 0.5 micrometers) of which one or dendrites emerged from the same pole (Figs. 14, 17). The labelled processes were observed in a different focal plane, halfway between the two groups of cell bodies, i.e., in the middle sublayer of the IPL (Fig. 13). They formed a sense plexus of thin, intermingled varicose processes morphologically quite different from that formed in the outermoust sublayer of the IPL by the processes of the flat TH-positive stellate cells.....In the upper nasal fragments, the population was slightly greater, but the majority of PNMT-positive cells were observed in the peripheral part of the upper retina.,Regional specialization of the rat retina: catecholamine-containing amacrine cell characterization and distribution,Versaux-Botteri C., Martin-Martinelli E., Nguyen-LeGros J., Geffard M., Vigny A. & Denoroy L.,Mihail Bota

205,projecting star neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The soma of a PSN is rounded or polygonal, measuring 20–23 micrometers, with a smooth, convex profile. These neurons send out three to seven primary dendrites that diverge radially (Fig. 12A, neurons b and c). Most frequently, primary dendrites ramify shortly after leaving the soma (<35 micrometers), issuing long, usually terminal branches. The diameter of distal, i.e., secondary, dendrites is uneven because of conspicuous varicosities along the shafts. Although primary dendrites are virtually devoid of spines, second- and third-order branches exhibit a moderate to high number of them. The distal parts of terminal dendrites resolve into rows of small tubercles similar to those described for the SSN type (see above). The axon arises from a distinct axonal cone at the basal aspect of the soma. After a relatively short distance (<20 micrometers), the axon becomes very thin (<0.3 micrometers) and follows a straight or slightly arched path. Before leaving the nuclear domain, the parent axon provides one to three collaterals to the neuropil.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat. II.

207,Purkinje neuron Cajal (Cajal (Cb)),According to Ramon y Cajal (1911), their cell bodies are between 35 and 65 micrometers in man. In the rat the cell bodies are 21 micrometers in diameter and 25 micrometers long on the average. There are 3.5 X 105 [Purkinje cells] in the rat (Armstrong & Schild, 1970). The cell bodies are arranged in a sheet one cell thick at the interface between the molecular and granular layers without any obvious pattern or clustering. In the rat Armstrong and Schild obtained a mean density of 1200 Purkinje cells per mm2 of Purkinje cell sheet by one methosd of counting, and by other method of counting a mean density of 1080 cell per mm 2. In Nissl preparations the cell body is characterized by its large, pale nucleus, an intensely basophilic nucleus, and scattered, rather small, polygonal Nissl bodies. The nucleolus of the Purkinje cell is an impressive, approximately spherical body usually lying near the center of the nucleus, but occasionally near the nuclear envelope. The dendritic tree of the Purkinje cell arises from one to four trunks that issue out of the apical pole of the cell body. The trunks extend directly outward or at an angle toward the surface of the folium, depending upon the location of the cell in the folium. The most remarkable characteristic of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree is its three-dimensional form. It is spread out in a vertical plane at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the folium, and is therefore displayed best in parasagittal sections. In this plane the tree extends to 300 to 400 micrometers, while in the longitudinal axis of the folium it is only 15 to 20 micrometers wide (see Fig. 10). The second remarkable characteristic of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree is its rich complement of thorns (Figs 7 and 23). The axon of the Purkinje cell arises from a barely perceptible projection on the basal pole of the soma. As Ramon y Cajal (1911) remarked, there is no clear line of demarcation between the cell body and the axon, as small granules of Nissl substance enter into the first part of the latter.,Cerebellar cortex.

208,PVN pre-autonomic type A neuron Stern (Stern),PVN preautonomic type A neurones were located exclusively in the PaV subnucleus and were the most common cell type labelled, accounting for 52 % of all labelled neurones in the PVN (Fig. 3A). They had a mean cross-sectional soma area of 134.8 ± 15.4 µm2. Dendrites were often varicose, and short spinous processes were occasionally observed. A common observation (also found for the other neuronal types) was that distal dendritic branches extended beyond the boundaries of the subnucleus and tended to approach the walls of the 3V. A morphometric analysis of reconstructed neurones showed that type A neurones (n = 33) had 2.7 ± 0.1 primary dendrites, which gave rise to 6.4 ± 0.7 branches. The TDL, MDL and mean path length (MPL) were 2093.7 ± 215.8 µm, 766.6 ± 91.4 µm and 399.7 ± 33.2 µm, respectively (see Fig. 4, for comparison with the other neuronal types). Axons were identified by their thinner diameter and beaded appearance...axons [...] could be traced for several hundred micrometres, running laterally or ventrolaterally towards the lateral hypothalamic area. In 25/33 (78 %) type A neurones, axons arose from a primary dendrite at a mean distance from the soma of 41± 5 µm (Fig. 3A1 and A2). In the remaining type A neurones, axons arose directly from the soma.,Electrophysiological and morphological properties of pre-autonomic neurones in the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus,Stern J.E.,Mihail Bota
209,PVN pre-autonomic type B neuron Stern (Stern),PVN preautonomic type B neurones were located exclusively in the PaPo subnucleus, and accounted for 25 % of the recorded neurones (Fig. 3B). They had a mean crosssectional soma area of 188.7 ± 4.2 µm2, which was not significantly different from the other PVN pre-autonomic neurones (P > 0.5, one-way ANOVA). A morphometric analysis of reconstructed neurones revealed that type B pre-autonomic neurones (n = 15) had the most complex dendritic arborization, as compared to the other neuronal types. Type B neurones had 3.8 ± 0.1 primary dendrites, which gave rise to 10.7 ± 1.9 branches (both parameters were significantly larger than the other neuronal types, P < 0.001 and P < 0.02, respectively, one-way ANOVA, Fig. 4). The TDL was also significantly larger than in the other neuronal types (5329.3 ± 1500 µm, P < 0.02, oneway ANOVA, Fig. 4). The MDL and MPL were 778.6 ± 310.7 µm and 390.5 ± 104.4 µm, respectively (not different from the other neuronal types). Similar to type A neurones, in the majority of cases (12/15, 80 %) axons arose from a primary dendrite, at a mean distance from the soma of 38 ± 6 µm.,Electrophysiological and morphological properties of pre-autonomic neurones in the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus,Stern J.E.,Mihail Bota
210,PVN pre-autonomic type C neuron Stern (Stern),PVN preautonomic type C neurones accounted for 23% of recorded neurones, with the great majority of them (83 %) located in the PaPo subnucleus (Fig. 3C). They had a mean cross-sectional soma area of 165.4 ± 40 µm2, with 3.1± 0.2 primary dendrites, which gave rise to 7.9 ± 0.9 branches (n = 17). Similar to the other neuronal types, dendrites were often varicose and tended to approach the walls of the 3V. In two cases, dendrites of type C neurones were observed to cross to the contralateral PVN (see Fig. 1D). The TDL, MDL and MPL of type C neurones were 2168.2 ± 750 µm, 692.9 ± 220 µm and 348.5 ± 86 µm, respectively. In contrast to type A and B neurones, in the majority of type C neurones (10/17, 60%), axons arose from the soma (Fig. 3C1 and C2). However, the incidence of axon origin was not significantly different between cell types (P = 0.1, x2 test).,Electrophysiological and morphological properties of pre-autonomic neurones in the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus,Stern J.E.,Mihail Bota
211,pyramidal cell Langer (Langer-SC),Pyramidal cells are similar to vertical fusiform cells in most respects. They have a vertically elongated cell body, about 15 micrometers in transverse diameter, in the deeper half of the zone of vertical cells. The dendritic field is narrow and cylindrical, 100- 250 micrometer in diameter, and extends from the upper margin of the zone of horizontal cells to the lower margin of the zone of vertical cells, about 500 micrometers. Rather than having superficial and deep fields, the pyramidal cell has the deep field reduced to a circumsomatic field, or a diminuitive basal field, and the superficial field is relatively elongated to accord with the deeper cell body. Pyramidal cells are usually multipolar, with one or two thick apical dendrites, which branch several times on the way to the surface, particularly in the upper portion of the zone of horizontal cells, and several smaller dendrites which form a small field about the cell body. It is of interest that smooth pyramidal cells tend to have two primary dendrites, like smooth vertical fusiform cells. The axon takes its origin from the soma or a low order dendrite and runs down into the deep zones. It is smooth and thin, about like that of the vertical fusiform cells.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota

214,radial multipolar neuron Van den Pol (Van den Pol),A fourth cell type in SCN, the radial multipolar, has from three to five primary dendrites that extend from the perikaryon like the spokes of a bicycle wheel (Fig. 15B). These cells are most commonly found in the dorsolateral and anterior SCN, often in the transition zone at the edge of SCN.,The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus of rat: intrinsic anatomy,van den Pol A.N.,Mihail Bota
215,reciprocal GABA-IR neuron, cerebellar nuclei Batini et al. (Batini),In each of the three nuclei examined, only a small proportion of the total number of retrogradely labeled NCN was found to be GABA-IR. Furthermore, the proportions of NCN containing GABA were very similar whether the nuclei gave reciprocal or symmetrical projections.,Cerebellar nuclei and the nucleocortical projections in the rat: retrograde tracing coupled to GABA snd glutamate immunohistochemistry,Batini C., Compoint C, Buisseret-Delmas C., Daniel H. & Guegan M.,Mihail Bota

218,retinal amacrine cell Rodieck (Rodieck),The name amacrine cell was given by Cajal to cells that have no axon. He observed such cells not only in the retina but also in other parts of the brain. In the retina none of the amacrine cells appear to have have axons or axonlike processes, with the possible exception of the so-called association amacrine observed by Cajal (Ramon y Cajal, 1892, 1911) in the bird retina; this amacrine cell type may be a short-axon amacrine cell similar to the short-axon horizontal cell. Usually all the processes of a single anacrine cell look similar when viewed in Golgi-stained material by light microscopy.,The vertebrate retina,Rodieck R.W,Mihail Bota
219,retinal bipolar cell Rodieck (Rodieck),The defining characteristic of a bipolar cell is that its dendritic processes terminate in or about the outer plexiform layers, where they make contact with photoreceptors, and its axonal processes terminate in or about the inner plexiform layer.,The vertebrate retina,Rodieck R.W,Mihail Bota
220,retinal ganglion cell Rodieck (Rodieck),A retinal ganglion cell is defined as a neuron whose perikaryon lies in the retina and which has an axon that becomes a fiber of the optic nerve. Ganglion cell perikarya usually lie in the ganglion cell layer just vitreally to the inner plexiform layer, although a few (displaced) ganglion cells are found in the inner plexiform layer or in the amacrine cell layer.,The vertebrate retina,Rodieck R.W,Mihail Bota
221,retinal ganglion cell loose type Brown-morphological (B-morpho),In Fig. 3, cells A, C, E, and G are of the “tight” type, while B, D, and F are of the “loose” type. The dendritic trees of the loose type do not penetrate the internal plexiform layer as deeply as those of the tight type (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The loose-type cells have fewer dendritic branches per main branch than the tight type (Table 1). the dendrites ramify (the “dendritic field”) may extend as much as 600-700 micrometers in the flat-mounted retina. The main dendrites of the loose type do not penetrate into the plexiform layer as steeply as do those of the tight type. The average size of dendritic field (Table 1) is 397 micrometers for loose-type cells and 282 micrometers for tight-type cells.,Dendritic fields of retinal ganglion cells of the rat,Brown J.E.,Mihail Bota
222,retinal ganglion cell tight type Brown-morphological (B-morpho),In Fig. 3, cells A, C, E, and G are of the “tight” type, while B, D, and F are of the “loose” type.

223,retinal ganglion cell A Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),This group includes all of the large-bodied/large-field RGCs in the rat...Group RGA cells...have large somata (15-39 micrometers in diameter) and large, radially branching dendritic fields (235-748 micrometers in diameter), and many exhibit tracer coupling. ...all Group RGA neurons have a radiating branching pattern, monstratify in the inner or outer sublaminae of the IPL, and display neuronal coupling to amacrine cells and other large-bodied ganglion cells.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
224,retinal ganglion cell A1 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Subgroup RGA1 cells (Figs. 2A, 3-5, Table 1) have a morphology similar to that of the giant cells of Bunt (1976). They have large somata, often polygonal in shape, from which a medium- to large-gauge axon emerges (Figs. 2A, 3). In one instance, a bifucarting axon was seen to exit the soma (see Fig. 3A). The large dendritic fields of RGA1 cells consist of three to seven stout dendrites that emerge radially from a centrally placed soma. The dendrites are smooth and overlap infrequently (Figs. 2, 3). RGA1 cells are found across the retina (Figs. 5, 6)and, on average, have the largest dendritic fields of all the RGCs labelled. RGA1 cells exhibited tracer coupling...they were strongly coupled to at least ten neurons (large-bodied gnalgion cells and some presumed amacrine cells-the latter gad very small somata and were found both the GCL and the INL; Fig.5).,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
224,retinal ganglion cell A1 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),We classified cells with a large soma and a large dendritic field as RGA, cells with a small- to medium-sized soma and a small- to medium-sized dendritic field as RGB, and cells with a small- to medium-sized soma but a medium-to-large dendritic field RGC. Seventy five RGA cells were identified. RGA cells had an average soma diameter of 23.4 micrometers, an average dendritic-field diameter of 300.0 micrometers, and a radial pattern of branching. They are similar to Perry’s type I cells (Perry, 1979).,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
225,retinal ganglion cell A2 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Alpha ganglion cells, which were defined by Peichl (1989), were identified and termed RGA2 in the present study (see Table 1). The RGA2 cell has a large soma from which a thick axon emerges. Four to eight stout primary dendrites project radially from the cell body and branch repeatedly in a Y-shaped pattern. The dendrites branch at regular intervals, with the first branch point being within half of a soma diameter of the cell body. This branching pattern gives the appearance of a relatively uniform, medium density of dendrites across the dendritic arbor. The cell body is usually situated at the centre of the dendritic field. They stratify at ... 72 ± 15% of the IPL (inner) or 34 &plusmin; 10% of the IPL (outer).,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
225,retinal ganglion cell A2 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),RGA2 cells had a round soma and 4–7 primary dendrites that branch repeatedly proximal to the soma. In contrast to the RGA1 cells, RGA2 cells have many more dendrites surrounding the soma (Fig. 3B).,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
226,retinal ganglion cell A2 inner Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Alpha ganglion cells, which were defined by Peichl (1989), were identified and termed RGA2 in the present study (see Table 1). The RGA2 cell has a large soma from which a thick axon emerges. Four to eight stout primary dendrites project radially from the cell body and branch repeatedly in a Y-shaped pattern. The dendrites branch at regular intervals, with the first branch point being within half of a soma diameter of the cell body.

226,retinal ganglion cell A2 inner Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),RGA1 cells had a polygonal cell body and 3–5 large primary dendrites. The distance between branching points is relatively even and distant from the soma, resulting in few number of dendrites around the soma (Fig. 3A). RGA1 cells only ramify in the inner part of the IPL (Table 1). They are identical to the inner alpha cells studied by Peichl (1989) and Tauchi et al. (1992).,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
226,retinal ganglion cell A2 inner Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),As Huxlin and Goodchild (1997), we identified two groups of RGA2 cells with dendrites stratifying in the inner and outer IPL (Table 1). They are morphologically similar to the outer alpha cells of Peichl (1989) and Tauchi et al. (1992).,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
227,retinal ganglion cell A2 outer Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Alpha ganglion cells, which were defined by Peichl (1989), were identified and termed RGA2 in the present study (see Table 1). The RGA2 cell has a large soma from which a thick axon emerges. Four to eight stout primary dendrites project radially from the cell body and branch repeatedly in a Y-shaped pattern. The dendrites branch at regular intervals, with the first branch point being within half of a soma diameter of the cell body. This branching pattern gives the appearance of a relatively uniform, medium density of dendrites across the dendritic arbor. The cell body is usually situated at the centre of the dendritic field.

227,retinal ganglion cell A2 outer Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),As Huxlin and Goodchild (1997), we identified two groups of RGA2 cells with dendrites stratifying in the inner and outer IPL (Table 1).

228,retinal ganglion cell B Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Sixty-eight neurons with small somata (12-24 micrometers in diameter), small dendritic fields (99-289 micrometers in diameter), and small axonal diameters (04.-07. micrometers in diameter) make up Group RGB. No tracer coupling was observed for neurons of this group, in which at least three distinct morphological subgroups were identified.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
228,retinal ganglion cell B Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),We classified cells with a large soma and a large dendritic field as RGA, cells with a small- to medium-sized soma and a small- to medium-sized dendritic field as RGB, and cells with a small- to medium-sized soma but a medium-to-large dendritic field RGC. One hundred and twenty five cells were classified as RGB (Table 1). RGB cells had an average soma diameter of 15.4 micrometers and an average dendritic-field diameter of 160.0 micrometes.,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
229,retinal ganglion cell B1 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Twenty-six neurons were defined as RGB1 cells (Fig. 8A, Table1). One of their characteristic features is the fact that the cell body always lies outside within the confines of the dendritic tree. They have the highest eccentricity of body relative to dendritic field of all ganglion cell identified. The majority of RGB1 cells analysed stratify diffusely within the IPL; nevertheless, their dendritic trees are centred in either the on- or the off- sublaminae of the IPL (Table 1). RGB1 cells were found across the retina.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota

230,retinal ganglion cell B2 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Fourteen neurons were defined as RGB2 cells (Figs. 2D, 8B). These cells are easy to distinguish by the very dense nature of their small dendritic trees. This high density is due to frequent, irregular branching of fine dendrites, which curve, twist, and overlap extensively (Fig. 2D). Their cell body is generaly located well within the confines of the dendritic tree. RGB2 cells were found across the retina (Fig. 9).,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota

They ramified almost in the middle of the IPL.,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
231,retinal ganglion cell B3 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Twenty-four cells were defined as RGB3 cells (Fig. 8C). The shape and branching patterns of their dendritic trees resemble those of RGA2 cells, although dendritic fields are much smaller. The somata are centrally located within the dendritic field. RGB3 cells show a greater range in dendritic field sizes than other RGB subgroups (Fig. 9), which suggests further heteronegeitiy.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota

Their morphology was more heterogeneous than that of Groups RGA and RGB.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
235,retinal ganglion cell C Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),We classified cells with a large soma and a large dendritic field as RGA, cells with a small- to medium-sized soma and a small- to medium-sized dendritic field as RGB, and cells with a small- to medium-sized soma but a medium-to-large dendritic field RGC. One hundred and fifty one cells were classified as RGC cells (Table 1). They had an average soma diameter of 15.8 micrometers and an average dendritic-field diameter of 245.6 micrometers.,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
236,retinal ganglion cell C others Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),The Group RGc cells, as mentioned above, are a heterogeneous population: we labelled several neurons that could not be classified as RGC1 or RGC2. Includes previously described exmples of Type III or Class III cells (Perry, 1979, Dreher et al., 1985), with their small somata and, in some cases, very large dendritic fields.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
237,retinal ganglion cell C1 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),Five RGc1 cells were labelled that have small somata and large asymmetrical dendritic fields (Figs. 10A, 12). Although only a small number of them were labelled, they resemble the medial terminal nucleus (MTN)-projecting cells described by Dann and Buhl (1987). Compared with neurons in Group RGA, RGC1 cells have smaller cell bodies, a higher density of dendritic branching, and usually asymmetrical dendritic fields.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
237,retinal ganglion cell C1 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),The RGC1 cells exhibited smooth, small caliber, recursive dendrites extending from large primary ones. Dendritic field was of medium density (Fig. 6A). The RGC1 stratified mostly in the inner IPL. Their morphology is very similar to the MTN-projecting cells characterized by Dann and Buhl (1987).,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
238,retinal ganglion cell C2 Huxlin and Goodchild (HG),RGC2 gave a morphology similar to the delta ganglion cells of Peichl (1989). They have a small to medium-sized somata from which fine axons emerge. Two to four primary dendrites branch close to the soma. These and subsequent branches twist and turn, unlike the radiating dendrites of the Group RGA neurons. The soma is usually central to the dendritic field. The dendritic fileds are smalled than those Group RGA cells at the same eccentricities, and they show little variation in size as a function of eccentricity (Fig. 12). RGC2 neurons did not exhibit tracer coupling, but many have numerous and prominent dendritic spines.,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota

245,retinal ganglion cell Class I Dreher (Dreher),HRP-labelled Class I cells, like Type I cells identified by Perry [1979] in Golgi-stained wholemounts of rat retina...have 3-7 fairly large-gauge primary dendrites, each of which bifurcates at least once, with the initial branches being about half the width of the parent dendrite. Their dendritic trees, irrespective of the location of the cell body, tend to be large (up to 470 micrometers in diameter).

245,retinal ganglion cell Class I Dreher (Dreher),Retrogradely filled type I (Perry, 1979) or class I (Dreher et al. 1985) have large perikarya (21.9 ± 3.4 micrometers in diameter; range 14:6-32.1; n=38) and large dendritic fields (318 ± 55 micrometers in diameter; range: 186-409; n=38) (Figs. 2, 5). Type I RGCs were evenly distributed across the retina and did not change substantially in size with retina eccentricity. The primary dendrites (3 to 7; Fig. 2) appeared to be relatively thick. The branching frequency (60 ±19 branching points; n=21) was less than that of type II and more than that of type III cells (Fig. 6). The dendrites of type I cells were rather smooth (Fig. 2). As also illustrated in figure 2, the axons of type I cells were relatively thick. ...these cells were monostratified and confirmed Perry's (1979) observatiopns on Golgi-stained material.,Morphology of ganglion cell dendrites in the albino rat retina: an analysis with fluorescent carbocyanine dyes,Thanos S,Mihail Bota
246,retinal ganglion cell Class IIa Dreher (Dreher),RGC2 gave a morphology similar to the delta ganglion cells of Peichl (1989). They have a small to medium-sized somata from which fine axons emerge. Two to four primary dendrites branch close to the soma. These and subsequent branches twist and turn, unlike the radiating dendrites of the Group RGA neurons. The soma is usually central to the dendritic field. The dendritic fileds are smalled than those Group RGA cells at the same eccentricities, and they show little variation in size as a function of eccentricity (Fig. 12). RGC2 neurons did not exhibit tracer coupling, but many have numerous and prominent dendritic spines. RGC2 neurons stratify in the outer...laminae of the IPL. Their stratification range, however, is relatively broad, averaging 33% of the IPL (Table 1).,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
246,retinal ganglion cell Class IIa Dreher (Dreher),Class IIa cells have small- to medium-sized somata (11-22 micrometers) and 1-4 medium gauge primary dendrites with many short branches giving them a bushy appearance.

The primary dendrites are fine and have only a few branches (fig. 1F), while the intraretinal axons of fine to medium calibre (0.3-0.8 micrometers in diameter; fig 3B).

248,retinal ganglion cell Class III Dreher (Dreher),The 35 completely retrogradely filled RGCs of type III, distinguished in accordance with the morphological criteria provided previously (Fukuda 1977; Perry 1979; Perry and Walker 1981; Dreher et al. 1985) appeared to present the following characteristics: small to medium-sized perikarya (15.9 ± 2.5 micrometers in diameter; range 10.0 to 22.0 micrometers; n=35) and large dendritic trees (299 ± 63 micrometers in diameter; range 145-436; n=35) (Fig. 4, 5). The dendritic arbors emerged from 3 to 6 primary dendrites. The branching frequency was 40.9 ± 10.6.

249,retinal ganglion cell D1 Sun (Sun),RGD1 cells had extremely thin, curvy, and recursive dendrites (Figs. 7A & 7B). The dendrites were distinctly bistratified, at depths of 62 ± 12% and 38 ± 17%, respectively.,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
250,retinal ganglion cell D2 Sun (Sun),RGD2 cells presented a medium-density field composed of recursive and loop-forming dendrites, and stratified in the IPL at depths of 64 ± 9% and 38 ± 12% (Figs. 7C & 7D). They were very similar in morphology to rabbit direction-selective ganglion cells (Amthor et al., 1984, 1989).,Large-scale morphological survey of rat retinal ganglion cells,Sun W., Li N. & He S.,Mihail Bota
251,retinal ganglion cell type I Perry (Perry),Type I cells have the largest cell bodies of all the classes (see table 1). The primary dendrites are generally smooth in appearance but sometimes have dendritic spines, and roughly halve their diameter at the first bifurcation (see plates 1, figures 1 and 2). The cells have 3 to 6 primary dendrites which enter the inner plexiform layer diagonally and appear to terminate in the outer part of inner plexiform layer. On many of these cells an axon could be identified and the axons were in general the thickest observed.,The ganglion cell layer of the retina of the rat: a Golgi study,Perry V.H.,Mihail Bota
251,retinal ganglion cell type I Perry (Perry),Retrogradely filled type I (Perry, 1979) or class I (Dreher et al. 1985) have large perikarya (21.9 ± 3.4 micrometers in diameter; range 14:6-32.1; n=38) and large dendritic fields (318 ± 55 micrometers in diameter; range: 186-409; n=38) (Figs. 2, 5). Type I RGCs were evenly distributed across the retina and did not change substantially in size with retina eccentricity. The primary dendrites (3 to 7; Fig. 2) appeared to be relatively thick. The branching frequency (60 ±19 branching points; n=21) was less than that of type II and more than that of type III cells (Fig. 6). The dendrites of type I cells were rather smooth (Fig. 2). As also illustrated in figure 2, the axons of type I cells were relatively thick. ...these cells were monostratified and confirmed Perry's (1979) observatiopns on Golgi-stained material.,Morphology of ganglion cell dendrites in the albino rat retina: an analysis with fluorescent carbocyanine dyes,Thanos S,Mihail Bota
252,retinal ganglion cell type II Perry (Perry),Type II cells have intermediate cell bodies and usually have smaller dendritic fields thant either type I and type III cells (see table 1). The number of primary dendrites varies from 1 to 4 in number and these pass into the outer layers of the inner plexiform layers. The cells have many short branches along the primary dendrites and the dendrites may be spiny (plate 2, figures 4, 5 and 6; and figure 9).,The ganglion cell layer of the retina of the rat: a Golgi study,Perry V.H.,Mihail Bota
252,retinal ganglion cell type II Perry (Perry),Type II cells have small to middle-sized somata (16.7 ± 2.5 micrometers in diameter; range 11.2- 24.7; n=162) and small to middle sized dendritic fields (187 ± 40 micrometers; range: 134-3233; n=162) (Fig. 3, 5). The characteristic bushy morphology of the dendritic ramification allowed in most cases rapid identification of these cells. The primary dendrites were thin and bifurcated in close proximity of the somata. The branching frequency of type II cells (88 ± 19 branching points; n=41) (Fig.6) was the highest observed among the various RGC types. The short tortuous branches often appeared to be beaded (Fig. 3).,Morphology of ganglion cell dendrites in the albino rat retina: an analysis with fluorescent carbocyanine dyes,Thanos S,Mihail Bota
253,retinal ganglion cell type III Perry (Perry),Type III cells have small bodies but they have the largest range of dendritic field sizes (see table 1). The dendrites of this cell class branch less frequently than those of the other classes. This group of cells encompasses a slightly wider variety of dendritic morphology, than the other three classes.,The ganglion cell layer of the retina of the rat: a Golgi study,Perry V.H.,Mihail Bota
253,retinal ganglion cell type III Perry (Perry),The 35 completely retrogradely filled RGCs of type III, distinguished in accordance with the morphological criteria provided previously (Fukuda 1977; Perry 1979; Perry and Walker 1981; Dreher et al. 1985) appeared to present the following characteristics: small to medium-sized perikarya (15.9 ± 2.5 micrometers in diameter; range 10.0 to 22.0 micrometers; n=35) and large dendritic trees (299 ± 63 micrometers in diameter; range 145-436; n=35) (Fig. 4, 5). The dendritic arbors emerged from 3 to 6 primary dendrites. The branching frequency was 40.9 ± 10.6. Branching points (Fig. 6) the lowest observed among the RGC classes.,Morphology of ganglion cell dendrites in the albino rat retina: an analysis with fluorescent carbocyanine dyes,Thanos S,Mihail Bota
254,retinal ganglion cell type IV Perry (Perry),RGC2 gave a morphology similar to the delta ganglion cells of Peichl (1989). They have a small to medium-sized somata from which fine axons emerge. Two to four primary dendrites branch close to the soma. These and subsequent branches twist and turn, unlike the radiating dendrites of the Group RGA neurons. The soma is usually central to the dendritic field. The dendritic fileds are smalled than those Group RGA cells at the same eccentricities, and they show little variation in size as a function of eccentricity (Fig. 12). RGC2 neurons did not exhibit tracer coupling, but many have numerous and prominent dendritic spines. RGC2 neurons stratify in the inner...laminae of the IPL. Their stratification range, however, is relatively broad, averaging 33% of the IPL (Table 1).,Retinal ganglion cells in the albino rat: revised morphological classification,Huxlin K.R & Goodchild A.K.,Mihail Bota
254,retinal ganglion cell type IV Perry (Perry),A fourth type of cell was characterized by the distinctive appearance of its dendrites (see plate 1, figure 1; and figure 11). These cells have small round cell bodies (see table 1) with a single primary dendrite passing a short distance into the inner plexiform layer before branching on a plane.

257,rod Cajal-Detwiler-Walls (C-D-W),When observed in the human retina fixed with osmic acid, these processes appear as glossy cylinders...Rods contain two segments-outer and inner-that are very distinct in osmicated preparations. ...All vertebrates including fish, have outer segments, although it is believed that they are absent in some birds; they are very abundant in nocturnal animals such as the larged horned owl, barn owl, rat and mouse. The inner segment is a bit longer and thicker than the outer segment. It is finely granular, stains lightly with carmine and the basic aniline dyes, and is unaffected by osmic acid. Rod perikarya (Fig. 190a) lie at various depths in the layer under consideration and contain a very small amout of cytoplasm, along with an ovoid nucleus that is smaller than that of cones.,Histology of the nervous system of man and vertebrates.

257,rod Cajal-Detwiler-Walls (C-D-W),Four days:..Mitotic figures are less numerous in the fundus than in the three-day retina, but as the ora is approached many mitotic figures are still to be seen (fig. 5). The protoplasmic extensions (developing rods) beyond the external limiting membrane are only very slightly, if any, longer than in the three day retina (table 1). Six days: ...The rod development has progressed slightly over conditions in the five-day retina (table 1 and fig. 8). In the region of the fundus they average about 3 microns in length, whereas at the ora, they are about 1.5 microns long. Eleven and twelve days: At this period the growth in length of the rods begins to accelerate markedly. In fact, it might be said that this rapid growth begins at almost the tenth day and it continues on up to about the sixteenth or seventeenth day (fig. 8), when the growth curves can he seen to plateau. Another feature of the fixed retina at twelve days, which appears significant in relation to conditions to be described in the fresh retina, is the fact that now the external segments not only stain deeply with the haematoxylin, but they begin to show a characteristic beaded appearance with deeply staining granules lying not only within the outer segment (both light and dark eyes), but occasionally outside of the rods themselves, particularly in the dark-adapted eyes (fig. 9). No especial developmental features of the developing retina were noticeable in older stages (from thirteen days on) other than gradual increase in the lengths of the rods. Between ten and eighteen days these had grown in length from 5 or 6 microns to 25 microns, at which time the growth became slower (fig. 8). By twenty-five days after birth the rods measured 30 microns in length.

268,SCN-projecting retinal ganglion cell Moore (Moore),Examination of whole mounts of a retina contralateral to the injected eye reveals a population of infected ganglion cells that appears to have a relatively uniform distribution across the retina. Individual neurosn have spherical-to-oval perikarya with two-to-four thin, sparsely branching proximal dendrites (Fig. 5). Dendrites extend radially from the cell soma, but the full extent of the dendritic arbors cannot be determined because the viral immunoreactivity does not extend into distal dendrites.... With Flurogold injections into the SCN that do not appear to extend into the optic chiasm, the labeled ganglion cells have a median area of 100 micrometers square. The mean area is 109.7 micrometers square and the mean diameter is 14.3 micrometers square. In addition ot the large numbers of small ganglion cells labeled there is a small number of larger cells with areas ranging from 160 to 250 micrometers square and diameters ranging from 18 to 22 micrometers. The data for the PRV injections in intact animals appear similar except that the median area (70 micrometers square), mediam diameter (12 micrometers), mean area (96.2 micrometers square) and mean diameter (13.7 micrometers) are all smaller than in the Fluorogold group. ...We interpret these differences to reflect that both the Fluorogold group and the intact PRV group are showing labeled ganglion cells that project to areas other than the SCN.,The retinohypothalamic tract originates from a distinct subset of retinal ganglion cells,Moore R.Y., Speh J.C. & Card J.P.,Mihail Bota
270,simple bipolar neuron Van den Pol (Van den Pol),The least differentiated cell in the SCN, that can be designated simple bipolar, has two primary dendrites at opposite ends of the perikaryon, giving the neuron a fusiform or bipolar shape. The dendrites may not branch at all (Fig. 14A) or they may branch once or twice (Fig. 14B), usually at the distal part of the dendrite. Spines are either absent or rare. Dendrites tend to stay in a fairly linear orientation, seldom doubling back or diverging much from the original course of the proximal dendrite. If the soma is found at the periphery of the SCN, dendrites may curve parallel to the general curvature of the nuclear boundaries. These simple neurons are found commonly in two areas of the SCN. In coronal sections, they lie dorsal to the optic chiasm or supraoptic commissure, with the dendritic elongation perpendicular to the midline. The medially directed dendrite proceeds toward the midline where it may turn dorsally. A second place within the SCN where the simple neuron is commonly found is in horizontal sections, close to the midline, with dendrites running parallel to the tractus infundibularis of Krieg ('32).,The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus of rat: intrinsic anatomy,van den Pol A.N.,Mihail Bota
271,slow-conducting retinal ganglion cell Fukuda-physiological (F-physio),Further support for the three-group classification of ganglion cells was gained by physiological measurements of conduction velocities of ganglion cell axons. By recording axonal or cellular discharges in the retina values of 16.8 ± 1.5, 11.4 ± 1.0 and 6.3 ± 1.1 m/sec were obtained as the average velocities of the fast, intermediate and slow conducting axons.

272,small basket cell SSp-morpho-electrophysiological types (M-morpho-electr),[Small basket cells] SBCs are [as large basket cells] also aspiny multipolar cells that place 20�30% of their synapses on target cell somata(Fairenet al., 1984; Kisvarday et al., 1985). Their axonal arbors, composed of frequent short, curvy axonal branches, tend to be near their somata and within the same layer.,Anatomical, physiological, molecular and circuit properties of nest basket cells in the developing somatosensory cortex,Wang Y., Gupta A., Toledo-Rodriguez M., Wu C.Z. & Markram H.,Mihail Bota
273,small pyramidal neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),A second type of cell, representing 6% of the neurons of the Ju, is commonly found within the dorsal part of the Ju and is characterized by an oval to triangular perikaryon, an ascending dendrite, and two or three basal dendrites (Figs. 2, neuron b; 3A, neuron p). Because of these latter characteristics and because its axon leaves the nuclear borders, these cells will be referred to as “small pyramidal cells.” The somata of these neurons measure from 15 to 18 micrometers in the longest axis. The primary dendrites arise from the dorsal and lateral part of the perikaryon and within 10–50 micrometeres give rise to secondary and tertiary, usually terminal dendrites. A typical feature of these cells is the presence of numerous dendritic spines, which are more numerous in the tertiary and, when present, in the quaternary branches. In general, spines are less frequent along the dendritic tree than in bipolar neurons. Twenty of the twenty-four pyramidal neurons studied here are found within dorsal regions of the nucleus (Table 1). Neurons in the former location have both the apical and one of the basal dendritic trees entangled with the axonal fascicles of the StT and IC. The axon of these neurons, which is visualized in five cases, projects laterally, to the caudoputamen (Fig. 3A, neuron p); dorsally, ascending mixed with the StT; or, ventrally, to either the SI or the rhomboid nucleus (Table 2).,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota

The superficially directed dendrites often terminate in supragranular layers, sometimes as far as layer II.

279,spine sparse neuron McDonald (McDonald),A few smaller spine sparse neurons were observed in the dorsal portion of the lateral subdivision and dorsomedial to this subdivision (Fig. 2, cell A).

280,spinous layer IV first variety SSp-layer IV-morphology, general (W.),The first variety of class I cell resembles the spiny �stellate� cell described by other observers in various cortices and species (see Lund, 1984). Four to six dendrites radiate from a round soma approximately 6-8 micrometers in diameter. These dendrites are of equivalent thickness and in many cases radiate from the cell body in all directions to form a dendritic �field� that is largely restricted to layer IV. Spiny �stellate� cells are found almost exclusively in layer IV where they are distributed fairly evenly throughout its thickness, with a slight preponderance in the more superficial part of layer IV [...]. Other cells, which otherwise closely resemble these, have eccentrically oriented dendritic arbors which arise from a restricted part of the soma. The cell bodies of these neurons are found typically near a barrel side or at the layer IV-V boundary, and [...} their dendrites project toward the barrel center or follow closely the barrel side.,Morphology of Golgi-Cox-impregnated barrel neurons in rat SmI cortex.,Simons D.J & Wolsey T.A.,Mihail Bota
281,spinous layer IV neuron SSp-layer IV-morphology, general (W.),[...] consists of cells which are multiform in appearance, giving rise to as many as ten primary dendrites. These processes radiate from the soma in all directions to arborize within layer IV, and often in nearby regions within supra- and infragranular laminae as well. When their somata are located near a barrel side or the layer IV-V border, dendrites arise from a restricted region of the perikaryon and project into the barrel center. Cells of this variety were also observed in other laminae, except I.,Morphology of Golgi-Cox-impregnated barrel neurons in rat SmI cortex.,Simons D.J & Wolsey T.A.,Mihail Bota

282,spiny bipolar neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The most frequent neuronal type found in the Ju is a spiny bipolar cell that accounts for about 78% of the impregnated neurons (Figs. 2, neurons a and e; 3A, neuron b; 4C; 5A). In sagittal sections, the dendritic arborization of these neurons corresponds to that of typical bipolar neurons; the paired primary dendrites run in opposite directions, generating narrow dendritic fields, as defined by Peters (1984) and Peters and Jones (1984), that extend through the dorsoventral extent of the Ju. The somata and proximal dendrites of bipolar neurons tend to be located within the middle one-third of the Ju, as depicted in horizontal sections (Fig. 2, inset). These bipolar neurons correspond to the cell type “restricted to the confines of this small region,” described by McDonald (1983), and appear to represent the main projection cell of the nucleus (see below). The somata of these neurons are most frequently oval, with smooth contours; however, some somata display irregular indentations and a few spine-like protrusions (Fig. 3A). Two or three primary dendrites run vertically in opposite directions from the soma. An additional primary dendrite can originate from the caudal aspect of the soma.,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota

284,spiny bipolar neuron ST-axon Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),Possible specific type of the spiny bipolar neurons found in the BSTju that is characterized by the path taken by its axon. [...] Ascending axons are the most frequent (Table 2) and consist of straight fibers that run for 100–400 micrometers without branching. Then, they follow a zigzag trajectory, providing numerous collaterals associated with the dorsal dendritic fields of the neighboring bipolar neurons. Frequently, these collaterals appear to contact dendrites of the adjacent bipolar neurons and those emerging from the parent cell body, i.e., autapses. The axon then ascends intermingled with fibers of the StT, providing further short, straight collaterals along its path.,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota
285,spiny bipolar neuron with bifurcated axon Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),Possible type of the spiny bipolar neuron in BSTju based on the route taken by its axon. A second axonal pattern consists of a bifurcation into two branches that run in opposite directions. The dorsal branch usually ascends, joining the fibers of the StT, whereas the descending or ventral branch either runs together with the axons of the StT or exits from the Ju (Fig. 4C). When this occurs, the axon penetrates the neuropil of one of the following structures: the oval nucleus, caudoputamen, or SI.,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota

287,spiny neurogliaform neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The second type of neuron originating a dense axonal plexus is the spiny neurogliaform neuron. SNG shares somatic and dendritic characteristics with common spiny neurons (see above) but bears clear-cut somatic and axonal differences (Fig. 10A,B). In fact, the SNG exhibits a triangular or rhomboid soma that gives rise to three or four short primary dendrites that divide at a wide angle, resulting in secondary and tertiary spiny-laden dendrites. The ensuing dendritic field is rounded, measuring from 120 to 160 micrometers. The axon arises from the soma and shows a distinct axonal cone and initial segment. Then, the axon divides in a fashion similar to that described above for NG, but it generates larger axonal fields (300–350 micrometers in diameter) that often occupy the entire rostrocaudal and transversal extent of the Ov. Putative axonal connections of SNGs are shown in Table 2.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat. II.

288,spiny neuron McDonald (McDonald),The lateral subdivision of BST, located at the level of the anterior commissure (Fig. I) consists of a fairly homogeneous population of spiny neurons (Fig. 2, cell B). These cells have ovoid perikarya that average 17x 14 micrometers in diameter, and 4-5 primary dendrites that radiate in all directions. Dendrites branch several times and extend 150-200 micrometers from the cell body. Perikarya and primary dendrites exhibit few spines but secondary and more distal dendrites have a dense covering of spines (Fig. 2, cell B). Most spines consist of a short stalk capped by a small terminal swelling. Axons usually originate from the cell body and may exhibit spines on their axon hillock and initial segment. Axons, which can only be followed for 50-100micrometers until they pass out of the section or abruptly cease to impregnate, often give off one or more thin, beaded collaterals that appear to be confined to the vicinity of the cell. No preferred axonal trajectory was observed.,Neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis: a Golgi study in the rat,McDonald A.J.,Mihail Bota
289,spiny neuron SCN Van den Pol (Van den Pol),A fifth type of neuron in SCN is the spiny neuron (Fig. 16A, B). The cell body is often quite round. The dendrites have many appendages of varying shapes and sizes, ranging from a modest thorn to long strands, lollipop, and mushroom shapes, dumbells, and two stalks emanating from the same dendritic varicosity. These cells often have a large number of protuberances arising from the perikaryon. Lengths of appendages range from one micron to unusually long spine-like strings extending 10 micrometers from their point of origin. Appendages are sometimes seen bending over in such a fashion that the distal end of the appendage may abut the parent dendrite (Guldner and Wolff, '78) presented ultrastructural evidence that spines in the SCN may be presynaptic to the parent dendrite; spines whose distal end appears to contact the parent dendrite are not uncommon in Golgi impregnations of the SCN in both young and mature rats. Spines such as these are also seen in the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus in young rats.,The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus of rat: intrinsic anatomy,van den Pol A.N.,Mihail Bota
290,spiny neuron with chandelier-like axon Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),This cell type, usually found throughout the core of the Ov, is separately classified from other spiny neurons for its oval or triangular soma and, above all, ubiquitous axonal features (Fig. 9). The soma measures from 17 to 22 micrometers in the longest axis, and it gives rise to two or three thick primary dendrites devoid of spines. Primary dendrites are relatively short (20–70 micrometers), providing long secondary (120–200 micrometers) and occasionally tertiary, terminal dendrites. An abundance of dendritic spines is a prominent feature of secondary and tertiary dendrites. The dendritic field is roughly ovoid; it measures 150–300 micrometers and remains within the confines of the core. The axon stems from the soma or from the root of a primary dendrite, following an arched trajectory for 100–300 micrometers. Then, the axon gives rise to two to six long collaterals, which display small varicosities. A unique feature of SCA axons is the presence of short, straight collaterals issuing transverse drumstick terminals. These collaterals consist of rows of large, rounded swellings connected by very thin (0.2 micrometers) axoplasmic bridges, i.e., candles (Fig. 9).,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

291,spiny projection neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),A superficial spiny neuron sharing some somatodendritic features with SSNs (see above), is a projection cell also lying in the lateral part of the shell of the nucleus (Figs. 7B and 16, neuron 6). The soma of SPNs is usually pear-shaped, measuring from 22 to 32 micrometers in the longest axis. Three to six primary dendrites originate in the soma and give rise to short secondary or preterminal branches. Tertiary dendrites are longer (100–200 micrometers) than those from CSNs. An important, distinctive feature of SPNs is that secondary and successively distal dendrites are laden with dendritic spines. Because of both the higher number of primary dendrites and their ramification, the dendritic tree of these neurons is quite dense compared with that from SSNs. The axon of a SPN arises from the soma or the root of a primary dendrite, which, in either case, gives rise to a long, slender axon hillock. The axon itself is straight, and it provides short collaterals along its way that appear to terminate in the dendritic processes of the adjacent neurons as well as in those of the parent neuron itself (Table 2). Unlike spiny neurons lying in the adjacent caudoputamen (Wilson and Groves, 1980), both SSN and SPN are enmeshed in the axons of the StT, allowing unambiguous identification (Fig. 7B).,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

293,star pyramid SSp-layer IV-morphology, general (W.),A second variety of spinous layer IV neuron is distinguished by the presence of a superficially directed dendritic process which is drawn out from the soma to give an impression of an �apical� dendrite (see Fig. 3B). This apical-like dendrite arises from the pial aspect of a round cell body and frequently branches proximally into two or more daughter segments. These terminate in upper layer lV or ascend only a short distance to branch and terminate in lower layer III. A similar partially reconstructed cell was described in the PMBSF of mice by White (�78), who referred to it as a �modified pyramidal cell. A small number of cells, which more closely resemble �star� pyramids described by Lorente de No (�22, send their apical processes to the molecular layer and have somewhat larger, but also round, somata. In this paper, all spinous neurons having spherical somata and a distinct apically directed dendrite will be called �star pyramids.�,Morphology of Golgi-Cox-impregnated barrel neurons in rat SmI cortex.,Simons D.J & Wolsey T.A.,Mihail Bota

297,stellate neuron Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),The stellate cells compose a class of small polymorphous neurons lying in the outer two thirds of the molecular layer. They were described by a number of early authors, Fusari (1883), Ponti (1897), Smirnow (1897), in addition to Ramon y Cajal (1889b), who in his great book on the nervous system (1911) gave Smirnow the credit the most detailed and exact account of the different kinds of stellate cells.,Cerebellar cortex. Cytology and Organization,Palay L.S. & Chan-Palay V.,Mihail Bota
298,stellate neuron Langer (Langer-SC),The third major category of cells in the superior colliculus is the stellate cell. The cells are defined by the lack of over-all orientation to the dendritic fields which extend symmetrically from the cell body. Stellate cells are multipolar with dendrites arising from any portion of the cell body. The dendrites may range anywhere from gnarled to radiate with the gnarled spiny cells most frequent in the zone of horizontal cells and the smooth radiate cells increasingly more frequent in the deeper zones until they are almost the only cell type in the zones below the stratum opticum. The dimensions of the cell bodies and dendritic fields are comparable to those of other cells in the same zone and the dendritic field is generally contained within the same zone as the cell body. The axons of stellate cells have both local and/or distant distributions and a morphology characteristic of intrinsic axons. As with all the other cell types, the axon may take its origin from the cell body or a low order dendrite.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota

300,stratified diffuse amacrine cell Perry (Perry),Stratified diffuse amacrine cells have their dendrites lying in more than one plane but not extending the full of the inner plexiform layer. In the rat retina the arrangement of the dendirtes is visualized more readily in vertical sections than in whole mounts, and the dendritic filed is found to terminate in either the inner or the outer half of the inner plexiform layer, although the latter is more common. The cells have a mean soma size of 8.9 micrometers (range 7.5-10.5 micrometers; N = 15). Usually a single process leaves the cell soma and passes into the inner plexiform layer before a tight field of short branches is formed (see figure 8, plate 2, and figure 17); the mean dendritic size is 30 micrometers (range 20-46 micrometers; N = 15).,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota

303,superficial horizontal cell Langer (Langer-SC),Collator note: superficial horizontal cells are considered a separate type of the horizontal cell on the basis of the cell body localization. Cell bodies of superficial horizontal cells are located in the stratum zonale and in the upper stratum griseum superficiale (see Table 1 page 407). Otherwise, the definition of the superficial horizontal cell is identical with that of the class horizontal cell.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
304,superficial short axon stellate cell Chan-Palay (Chan-Palay),They can be quite superficial, lying just within the neuroglial end feet that form the limiting membrane under the pia. The superficial stellate cells have small somata about 5-10 micrometers in diameter. The appearance of their dendrites in Golgi preparations is typical of all stellate cells. They are irregular in caliber and very contorted, eith many abrupt changes in direction, as if twisting and hooking around invisible obstacles in their course. The dendritic trees of the steallate cells near the pial surface fall into two patterns. First, major dendrites can originate from opposite sides of the cell body, giving the cell a somewhat bipolar appearance. These dendrites can extend either horizontally, that is, parallel with the pial surface (Fig. 187A) or vertically (Fig. 188A, B). The axon of the stellate cell originates from the cell body (Fig. 186) or, less often, from a major dendrite (Fig. 187A, B, 188 A-C, and 190), by way a barely perceptible axon hillock. Thin, crooked collaterals arise from it at approximately right angles or somewhat less. In our preparations they are short, tenuous, varicose threads resembling strands of loosely strung, imperfect pearls (Figs. 186 to 191).,Cerebellar cortex. Cytology and Organization,Palay L.S. & Chan-Palay V.,Mihail Bota
305,superficial spiny neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The lateral part of the shell of the Ov contains a distinct layer of spiny neurons (Fig. 7A). Somata of SSNs are ovoid or triangular, measuring 18–25 micrometers in the longest axis. Primary dendrites have two or three short branches that run divergently. Within 10–40 micrometers, primary branches ramify, supplying long (i.e., secondary) dendrites that, in turn, provide occasional short terminal dendrites. Secondary and tertiary dendrites display varicosities and are covered by numerous spines. Frequently, terminal dendrites ascending dorsally terminate as a series of two to four spherical or elliptical swellings measuring 2–5 micrometers wide, united by narrow dendritic bridges, similar to those described by Sotelo and Palay (1968) in neurons from the lateral vestibular nucleus. The lenticular dendritic fields of SSN lie in the lateral part of the shell of the Ov. Hence, SSNs are best depicted from sagittal sections through the lateral part of the Ov (Fig. 7A). The axon of the SSN originates from the soma or at the base of a primary dendrite, without modifying its contour. Characteristically, the axon follows an undulating trajectory, providing short collaterals to the neuropil adjacent to the neuron’s own dendritic field. The main synaptic targets of SNN appear to be spiny projection neurons (Table 2), adjacent interneurons, and distal dendritic processes of neurons lying in the core of the Ov.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.

306,superficial vertical fusiform cell Langer (Langer-SC),The superficial vertical fusiform cells have cell bodies 10-15 micrometers wide lying in the zone of horizontal cells and send dendrites to the upper and lower margins of that zone (fig. 12c).,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
307,symmetrical GABA-IR neuron, cerebellar nuclei Batini et al.

310,TH-immunoreactive displaced amacrine cell Versaux-Boteri et al (VB),Among the population of stellate cells, two subtypes could be observed:...(2) the displaced amacrine cells, whose somata were found in the ganglion cell layer (alloganglion cells), sent especially long and strong processes to the IPL (Figs. 5., 6), and very often one thin process to the innermost sublayer of the IPL. The eremite cells displaced in the middle of the IPL were difficult to identify in flat mount, although occasionally some could be recognized. These cells had a well-delimited clear nucleus and their primary dendrites were especiallt thick and irregularly shaped. Their dendritic tree was particularly flat, lying in a focal plane in the middle of the IPL (Fig. 2).,Regional specialization of the rat retina: catecholamine-containing amacrine cell characterization and distribution,Versaux-Botteri C., Martin-Martinelli E., Nguyen-LeGros J., Geffard M., Vigny A. & Denoroy L.,Mihail Bota
311,TH-immunoreactive interplexiform cell Versaux-Boteri et al (VB),Among the population of stellate cells, two subtypes could be observed: (1) the interplexiform cells, whose somata and primary dendrites lay in the same focal plane as flat amacrines, but had processes directed to the outer plexiform later(OPL); the processes observed in this layer showed very close contacts with blood vessels (Fig. 3)....,Regional specialization of the rat retina: catecholamine-containing amacrine cell characterization and distribution,Versaux-Botteri C., Martin-Martinelli E., Nguyen-LeGros J., Geffard M., Vigny A. & Denoroy L.,Mihail Bota
312,TH-immunoreactive small amacrine cell Versaux-Boteri et al (VB),Small, faintly immunoreactive round somas (7 ± 0.2 micrometers) were also observed in the amacrine cell layer (Figs. 11, 15). It was exceptional to observe the processes of these cells but it is likely that they represented the bouquet cells described previously in young animals, since they sometimes exhibited a short single dendrite. Some of these cells were observed in close contact with cell bodies (Fig. 4).,Regional specialization of the rat retina: catecholamine-containing amacrine cell characterization and distribution,Versaux-Botteri C., Martin-Martinelli E., Nguyen-LeGros J., Geffard M., Vigny A. & Denoroy L.,Mihail Bota
313,TH-immunoreactive stellate amacrine cell Versaux-Boteri et al (VB),The stellate amacrine cells had a large ovoid soma (17.58 ± 1.45 X 14.28 ± 076 micrometers) bearing 2-4 primary dendrites in opposite directions. These dendrites were long, straight, and poorly branched. They had a more or less varicose appearance (Fig. 1) and were observed in approximately the same focal plane as the cell bodies, i.e., at the interface between the inner nuclear layer (INL) and the inner plexiform layer (IPL).

316,tranversely oriented neuron Ju et al. (Ju),The neurons in the transverse nucleus can be distinguished rather easily from those in the surrounding nuclei on two grounds. First, they are considerably more heterogeneous in shape and size; and second, their perikarya tend to assume a characteristic transverse orientation.,Studies on the cellular architecture of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in the rat: I.

317,triangular neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),Because of the dendritic field of these neurons, they are better visualized in sagittal sections (Fig. 2, neuron b). The soma is triangular or stellate and typically gives rise to three distinct primary dendrites that leave the soma from its dorsal and ventrolateral aspects. The dorsally directed dendrite pierces the ventral part of the Ju, and the ventral ones follow a horizontal direction, parallel to the AC. These primary dendrites seldom ramify; however, when this occurs, short secondary dendrites are found. Along these dendrites, moderate numbers of spines can be seen. In 16 of these neurons, the axon was visualized emerging from the ventral aspect of the soma or from a proximal dendrite. These axons follow four basic patterns of projection: They turn ventrally, entering the SI; they turn laterally, ascending to the ventral part of the caudoputamen; they turn medially, providing short, straight collaterals appearing to terminate on the somata of neurons in the dorsal part of the bed nucleus of the AC (Fig. 2, neuron d); finally, the axon bends dorsally or caudally, intermingled with fibers of the StT, providing short, wavy collaterals along its path.,Juxtacapsular nucleus of the stria terminalis of the adult rat: extrinsic inputs, cell types and neuronal modules: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study,Larriva-Sahd J.,Mihail Bota

319,type (a) narrow-field unistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),The type (a) narrow filed unistratified cell has previously been described by Perry (1979), and was called a type IV [collator note: retinal ganglion] cell. This type of cell can be found with its cell soma in either the ganglion cell layer or the inner nuclear layer. Unlike the other types of amacrine cell this type is found with its cell soma in the ganglion cell layer than in the inner nuclear layer. The dimensions of these cells (mean soma size 10.1 micrometers and mean dendritic field size 219 micrometers, from Perry (1979)) are the same in both layers. Examples of this cell type are shown in figure 3, plate 1, and figure 11.,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
320,type (a) wide-field unistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),This wide-field unistratified cell has a mean soma of 11.1 micrometers (range 8,8-12.5 micrometers; N = 13). A single dendrite arises from the cell soma before it branches on a plane. These brances, about 1 micrometer in diameter, then apss in many directions within tha plane; the bifurcations that do occur are near the cell soma and the dendrites take a straingth line across the retina (see figure 4, plate 1, and figure 13). Type (a) and type (b) wide-field unistratified amacrine cells have been found with their cell bodies in either the inner nuclear layer or in the ganglion cell layer (figure 14).,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
321,type (b) narrow-field unistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),The type (b) narrow-field unistratified cell has a similar [collator note: with the type (a) narrow field unistratified amacrine neuron] mean soma diameter of 9.2 micrometers (range 7.5-11.3 micrometeres; N = 14) and the size of its dendritic field is similar to the the type (a) narrow field unistratified cell (mean 215 micrometers; range 135-282 micrometers; N = 14). A single primary dendrite arises from the cell soma and passes into the inner plexiform layer before branching on a plane. In contrast with the type (a) narrow field unistratified cell this cell has coarser, mostly spine-free, dendrites. Figure 3 and 12 show examples of this cell tpye, one of which has its soma in the ganglion cell layer.,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
322,type (b) wide-field unistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),The second type of wide-field unistratified amacrine cell has a soma of similar size to that of the type (a) wide-field unistratified cells and the dendrites have the same thin unbranched appearance. Howevver, these cells do not send their dendrites in all directions but in only two in a single plan. As reported by Gallego (1971), these wide-field unistratified amacrine cells have a dendritic filed covering an area of an hour-glass (see figure 4 and 13). We have found cells with the dimensions 1850 micrometers X 640 micrometers and 1510 micrometers X 280 micrometers, but the majority of cells have dendrites that extend for at least 500 micrometers or more before coming to an abrupts end or leaving the piece of retina. These cells do not seem to have any particular orientation in the retina. Type (a) and type (b) wide-field unistratified amacrine cells have been found with their cell bodies in either the inner nuclear layer or in the ganglion cell layer (figure 14).,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
323,type (c) wide-field unistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),The tird type of cell in the wide-field unistratified class of amacrine cell has a distinct dendritic pattern. The mean soma size, 11.4 micrometers, is larger than the other two types range (10.0-13.0 micrometers; N = 10). Usually three but sometimes two large dendrites arise from the cell in the same layer as the soma. After a short distance a very fine branch comes off each of the larger branches, again in hte same plane as the cell soma (see figure 5, plate2, and figure 15).,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
324,type 1 cone bipolar cell Wassle (Wassle),Type 1 CB (n = 6, Fig. 1B) is an outer cone bipolar cell with a flat stratification in stratum 1 of the IPL and only one ascending primary dendrite that ramifies sparsely.,Immunocytochemical identification of cone bipolar cells in the rat retina,Euler T & Wasle H,Mihail Bota
325,type 1 glycinergic retinal amacrine cell Menger (Menger),The level of stratification of the branches within the IPL was taken as the defining criterion of the classification scheme. On this basis, eight different types could be distinguished. Unfortunately, the frequency of injection varied among the cell types and AII amacrines were encountered most often. Only one type 1 cell was encountered, but the quality of LY filling of this cell and its position within the slice rule out the possibility that it might be another type that was damaged by the slicing procedure. A schematic diagram of the eight different glycinergic amacrine cells is shown in Figure 10A, B.

342,type I (bursting) neuron, cerebellar nuclei Czubayko et al. (Czubayko),....type I neurons generated long plateau potentials in response both to depolarizing and to hyperpolarizing current pulses...After short suprathreshold depolarizing current pulses (300 ms), type I neurons typically generated plateau potentials topped with high-frequency trains of action potentials (Fig. 1C) .As measured from spontaneous action potentials (no bias current injected), action potential width and amplitude were significantly larger in type II neurons than they were in type I neurons (type I width, 1.52 ± 0.59 ms; type I amplitude, 66.7 ± 10.4 mV; see Table 1). Moreover, the form of the afterpolarizations exhibited by both types of neurons was more complex in type I neurons than it was in type II neurons...type I neurons showed a large variation in their dendritic features. The area of their somata and the maximal diameter of their dendritic trees ranged from 133 to 672 micrometer2 and 240 to 561 micrometer, respectively (Fig. 10B), which covered the whole spectrum of soma sizes demonstrated by Golgi stain techniques (Chan-Palay 1977). Dendritic trees were of variable forms and showed 2–8 basal dendrites. The proximal dendrites branched into thin distal dendrites covered with a few filiform dendritic appendages of different length, some of which resembled spines. Similar to the Golgi study of Chan-Palay (1977), our results showed that the appendages were unevenly distributed and sometimes appeared to be clustered.,Two types of neurons in the rat cerebellar nuclei as distinguished by membrane potentials and intracellular fillings,Czubayko U., Sultan F., Thier P. & Schwartz C.,Mihail Bota

As measured from spontaneous action potentials (no bias current injected), action potential width and amplitude were significantly larger in type II neurons than they were in type I neurons (type II width, 2.11 ± 0.45 ms; type II amplitude, 78.0 ± 8.6 mV; see Table 1). Both stained type II neurons displayed a soma that was among the smallest within the sample (140 and 130 mm2, Fig. 10B). Furthermore, the dendritic tree was in the smallest range of CN neurons and, when compared with type I neurons, was clearly rarified. In both cells, three basal dendrites emerged from the soma at opposing sides. The basal dendrites branched into a few thin, beaded, small-diameter dendrites that did not bear any dendritic appendages.,Two types of neurons in the rat cerebellar nuclei as distinguished by membrane potentials and intracellular fillings,Czubayko U., Sultan F., Thier P. & Schwartz C.,Mihail Bota

345,type I PVN neuron Tasker and Dudek (TD),Preliminary morphological analysis indicated that type I neurones had relatively large soma diameters (20-30 micrometers, long axis) and only two to three sparsely branched, primary dendrites with dendritic spines (Fig. 13A)....Type I neurones were situated inside the PVN and had electrophysiological properties which were very similar to those of magnocellular neurones of the SON. They had linear I-V relations to very hyperpolarized membrane potentials, much like SON neurones (Mason, 1983; Bourque & Renaud, 1985a). Type I neurones often displayed, in response to depolarizing pulses, a delayed onset to spike firing caused by a hyperpolarizing 'notch' in the membrane potential, as well as a delayed return to baseline of the membrane potential following hyperpolarizing pulses; these properties closely resembled those associated with a putative A-current described in SON magnocellular neurones (Randle, Bourque & Renaud, 1986a; Bourque, 1988). The bursting characteristics of some type I cells were similar to the phasic firing behaviour described for vasopressinergic magnocellular neurones in vivo and in vitro (see Poulain & Wakerley, 1982; Dudek, Tasker & Wuarin, 1989).,Electrophysiological properties of neurones in the region of the paraventricular nucleus in slices of rat hypothalamus,Tasker J.G. & Dudek F.E.,Mihail Bota
346,type I retinal bipolar cell Leure-Dupree (LD),This tpye of bipolar cell was most frequently seen. Its perikaryon lies in the inner nuclear layer and its apical dendrite divides many times in the outer plexiform layer (figs. 1-4) to form a number of small processes which extend to the level of the bases of the photoreceptor cells. The axon of the bipolar cell extends from the vitread surface if the perikaryon into the inner plexiform layer that expands into a bulbous terminal that usually ends in one or more swelling near the ganglion cell layer. This finding is in agreement with the classical light microscopic observations of Cajal ('11) and Polyak ('41). The range of diameters of the dendritic tree processes of Type I bipoalr cells was 15.6-21.2 micrometers. ...The flatness of the bipolar cells whose dendritic trees measure 10.4 micrometers and 13.0 micrometers respectively may suggest a third type. Each Type I bipolar cell is in contact with a minimum of ten photoreceptor cell terminals, and each photoreceptor cell terminal is in contact with several bipolar cells. Type I bipolars resemble in shape and position the rod bipolar cells of Cajal's classification (Cajal, '11), and are similar in morphology, size, shape, and position to those described in the rabbit retina (Raviola and Raviola '67) and in the primate retina (Boycott and Dowling '69).,Observations of the synaptic organization of the retina of the albino rat: a light and electron microscopic study,Leure-Dupree A.E.,Mihail Bota
347,type II ganglion cell Langer (Langer-SC),The Type II ganglion cells, like the piriform cells, have all or almost all of their dendritic field superficial to the cell body. The 15-25 micrometers cell body lies within a narrow range of depths at the deep margin of the zone of vertical cells from which it may send 3-7 primary dendrites vertically or obliquely towards the surface to form a dendritic field in excess of 400 micrometers in diameter and about 500 micrometers deep. The primary dendrites may derive from any portion of the cell body surface, but they usually arise from the dorsal or lateral surfaces. The dendrites of Type II ganglion cells intermingle, giving them a dense arbor of dendrites that extend over large regions of the superior colliculus. The axon may originate from the cell body or a low order dendrite. It may project into the region superficial to the cell body (figs. 9, 14) or into the deep zones (fig. 15). The axon of the superficial projection is similar to other intrinsic axons except for being thicker. It branches frequently to form an arbor approximately as wide as the dendritic field, which it overlaps, but they are not necessarily coincident, nor is one contained within the other.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
348,type II PVN neuron Tasker and Dudek (TD),Type II neurones tended to have smaller soma diameters (10-25,tm) and more highly branched dendritic arbors, with two to four primary dendrites giving rise to secondary branches (Fig. 13B). Type I and type II neurones generally had elongated, bidirectional dendritic orientations. Type II neurones were located within the PVN and showed electrophysiological properties which were distinct from those of type I neurones and SON magnocellular neurones. The principal distinguishing characteristic of these cells was their capacity to generate a small low-threshold potential, similar to that seen in some neurones of the neocortex (Friedman & Gutnick, 1987), the dorsal raphe nucleus (Burlhis & Aghajanian, 1987) and in dopamine-containing regions of the midbrain (Grace & Onn, 1989). The heterogeneity seen in the electrical properties of type II cells (e.g. low-threshold potentials of various amplitudes, inconsistent I-V relations across cells and differences in bursting behaviour) suggests that this group of neurones consists of more than one cell type. This electrophysiological heterogeneity is consistent with the diversity of anatomical and functional cell types that make up the parvocellular populations of the PVN (Armstrong et al. 1980; van den Pol, 1982; Swanson & Sawchenko, 1983).,Electrophysiological properties of neurones in the region of the paraventricular nucleus in slices of rat hypothalamus,Tasker J.G. & Dudek F.E.,Mihail Bota
349,type II retinal bipolar cell Leure-Dupree (LD),The Type II bipolar cell body, which is also located in the inner nuclear layer, does not possess as many dendritic branches as Type I bipolars. The apical dendrite usually does not branch until it is at the level of the photoreceptor terminals, and oftentimes it only bifurcates once (fig. 5). In some instances the dendritic branches extend in radial direction from the main vertical dendrite. The axon of the Type II bipolar cell branches in the sclerad portion of the inner plexiform layer (figs. 5, 6). The flattened axonal arborization consists of many branches which lie in the plane of the inner plexiform layer, confined to its outermost portion. Unlike the Type I bipolar cells, the axons of Type II bipolars never extend to or branch near the ganglion cell layer. These bipolar cells closely resemble in shape and position the flat top bipolars of Polyak ('41).,Observations of the synaptic organization of the retina of the albino rat: a light and electron microscopic study,Leure-Dupree A.E.,Mihail Bota
350,type III ganglion cell Langer (Langer-SC),The Type III ganglion cells resemble Type II ganglion cells in most respects. They are multipolar with 3 4 primary dendrites, a cell body 20-25 micrometers in major diameter, and a dendritic field which may be more than 1000 micrometers in diameter. They differ in that some of their dendrites extend below the cell body and their cell bodies lie in the zone of optic fibers. The axon almost invariably runs down into the deep portion of the colliculus. Type III ganglion cells tend to have fewer, but thicker, dendrites passing through the first two zones than is usual for Type II ganglion cells. The dendrites are less spiny, branch less often, but like the other types of ganglion cells, they break up into many fine branches as they approach the surface, particularly in the upper portion of the zone of horizontal cells.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
351,unipolar brush neuron Mugnaini (Mugnaini),These neurons have rounded or ovoidal cell bodies (9-12 micrometers in diameter) that are intermediate in size between granule and Golgi cells. Within a given folium, the UBCs occur at all levels of the granular layer (Fig 1.c), sometimes immediately beneath the Purkinje cell layer and also in the folial withe matter (Fig. 1c, f). These neurons emit a thin axon, 0.3 - 0.5 micrometers in diameter, and commonly give rise to a single, short and stubby dendrite, 2-3 micrometers in diameter, which usually divides only at the tip, where it forms a tightly packed group of branchlets covered by thin, spin-like appendages, resembling a paintbrush (Fig. 1b). The field occupied by the brush tip is rounded, ovoid, boxy, or, more often, cap-shaped and measures 10-30 micrometers in average diameter, forming a neuropil island, which may encompass no more than one or two glomerular synaptic fields. The axon of the UBC usually arises from the cell body (Fig. 1b), but it may also emanate from the dendritic trunk (Fig. 1g) or one of the tip's branchlets. Although we often saw UBCs with ascending axons, these processes usually curved back upon entering Purkinje cell layer and ceased to be impregnated. The UBCs were present at high densities in the nodulus (lobulus X; Fig. 1c), ventral uvula (lobulus IXc); at moderate densities in the ventral parflocculus and lingula (lobulus I); and less frequently in other vermal folia and were virtually absent from cerebellar hemispheres. The sites where UBCs occur at high densities largely overlap the cortical terminal regions of the vestibular afferents.,The unipolar brush cell: a neglected neurons of the mammalian cerebellar cortex,Mugnaini E. & Floris A.,Mihail Bota
352,unistratified ganglion cell Bunt (Bunt),A class of relatively large ganglion cells (soma diameter 17-22 micrometers) was characterized by several relatively thick apical dendrites whose branches were smooth in appearance, with only occasional knobs and spines, and appeared to ramify in two planes, in the outer one-third and middle one-third of the inner plexiform layer, with a gap in between (Fig. 10).

353,unistratified retinal ganglion cell Leure-Dupree (LD),The ganglion cells observed were of the unistratified type (Polyak, '41); their dendrites did not extend deep into the inner plexiform layer (figs. 19, 20). They were situated close to one another, and therefore, considerable overlapping of the dendritic trees may occur.

354,vertical fusiform cell Langer (Langer-SC),Vertical fusiform cells have narrow, cylindrical, vertically oriented dendritic fields and generally an elongated cell body, fusiform in its vertical axis. Both the cell body and the dendritic field vary in their dimensions depending upon the particular type of vertical fusiform cell. There are three types of vertical fusiform cells. All have dendritic fields 100-200 micrometers wide, with the more superficial cells having narrower fields. The cell bodies of vertical fusiform cells may be bipolar, with ascending and descending trunks or they may be multipolar. The most common configuration is of two ascending dendritic trunks and two descending dendritic trunks. The bipolar vertical fusiform cells are usually smooth cells and the multipolar vertical fusiform cells are usually spiny. The smooth vertical fusiform cells have thinner dendrites that branch less frequently, thus are less voluminous. The dendrites which arise from the superficial surface of the vertical fusiform cell’s soma are the principal source of the superficial field, and those which arise from the deep surface are the principal source of the deep field, but frequently branches from one of the primary dendrites will contribute to the other field. Usually the deep dendrites turn superficially. In the extreme case the entire deep field will turn to extend superficially. The axon of vertical fusiform cells commonly arises from one of the low order dendrites. It runs deep toward the ganglion zone of the superior colliculus. A few cells have local distributions which may extend throughout the depth of the superficial zones. The axon is similar to other intrinsic axons but thicker than those of the marginal or horizontal cells.,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota

Within the BST, PHA-L-labeled fiber terminal boutons were seen in direct apposition to Fluoro-gold-labeled neuronal cell bodies or proximal dendritic segments. In some cases Fluoro-gold-labeled neurons were seen surrounded by labeled terminals in pericellular basket arrangements highly suggestive of synaptic input, although typically cells were directly approximated by two to four labeled terminals.

359,wide field diffuse amacrine cell Perry (Perry),A diffuse amacrine cell has dendrites that branch at all levels of the inner plexiform layer. In the rat retina only one type of diffuse amacrine cell has been found, the wide-field diffuse amacrine cell. This cell type has a mean soma size of 10 micrometers (range 8.3-13.5 micrometers; N = 14). The extent of its dendritic field is difficult to define precisely; there is a core of short branches that extend vertically through the inner plexiform layer, and this core is surrounded by a number of branches that take an oblique course through the inner plexiform layer before terminating at variable distance from the cell soma at the level of ganglion cells. The dendrites of these cells have a characteristic varicose appearance and the ends of the dendrites often terminate with one of these swellings (see figure 1, plate 1, and figure 9). The dendritic field has a mean size of 177 micrometers (range 130-276 micrometers; N=14). The large range may be due to the difficulty in determining whether the cell is wholly stained or not. A similar cell type had been observed in the rat inner nuclear layer by Leure-Dupree (1974) although his cells seem to be undertained.,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
360,wide field vertical cell Langer (Langer-SC),There are two similar populations in the group of wide field vertical cells. The first lies in the deep margin of the zone of vertical cells where it looks very similar to the piriform cells relative to the zone of horizontal cells. Cajal called these the ovoid or triangular cells. The second population has its cell bodies distributed primarily to the upper portion of the zone of optic fibers. Cajal called these triangular or stellate cells. Cajal's nomenclature is rather bulky and, though descriptive, somewhat confusing because stellate cells are a distinct cell type in the nomenclature of this paper and triangular occurs in both names. For reasons developed below, the ovoid or triangular cells or wide field cells of the zone of vertical cells will be called Type II ganglion cells and the triangular or stellate cells or wide field cells of the zone of optic fibers will be called Type III ganglion cells. Type I ganglion cells are the piriform cells. Collator note: we assumed this class of neurons as projection neurons, because at least several subpopulations project to visually related areas. See Sefton et al., 2005; Mason and Groos, 1981; Mackay-Sim et al. 1983; Okoyama and Kudo, 1987).,The upper layers of the superior colliculus of the rat: a Golgi study,Langer T.P., Lund R.D.,Mihail Bota
361,wide-field amacrine cell Wassle (Wassle),The second population [of PV-immunoreactive amancrine cells] is more brightly fluorescent, sparsely distributed, and the cell bodies are larger and are positioned towards the center of the INL. In the Nomarski micrograph of Figure 5B the primary dendritic tree of these cells can be observed. They are a widefiled amacrine type with the primary dendritic field in strata 1 or 2 of the IPL. They are more strongly labeled than the AII-amacrine cells, and this together with the morphological differences made the separation of the two classes possible. AII-cells and the other labeled amacrine cells occur at a ratio of apporximately 12:1.,Imunocytochemical staining of AII-amacrine cells in the rat retina with antibodies agains parvalbumin,Wassle H, Grunert U & Rohrenbeck J,Mihail Bota
362,wide-field bistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),These wide-field bistratified cells have a process that leaves the soma and passes almost vertically through the inner plexiform layer before branching near the ganglion cell layer, but in addition they also have processes that run laterally at the level of the inner nuclear layer.,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
363,wide-field unistratified amacrine cell Perry (Perry),The wide-field unistratified cells fall in three subgroups. The measurements of the dendritic field are only considered to be estimates since we do not believe that we have ever seen these cells completely stained...,Amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells and interplexiform cells in the retina of the rat,Perry V.H. & Walker M.,Mihail Bota
364,wide-field unistratified diffuse amacrine cell Leure-Dupree (LD),The cell body is located in the inner plexiform layer and is often of rectangular shape. Several branches arise from around the lateral surface of the perikaryon and extend horizontally with relatively little branching. Other cell bodies appear flask-like in section and show a single process arising from the vitread surface of the perikaryon. This process descends into the inner plexiform layer for a short distance, then divides, and its processes extend horizontally. The horizontal extent of thrse cells was considerable and occupies primarily one plane in the inner plexiform layer, although a few vertical branches were seen. The range of diameter of the arborized processes as measured in 35 of these amacrine cells was from 62.4-143 micrometers.,Observations of the synaptic organization of the retina of the albino rat: a light and electron microscopic study,Leure-Dupree A.E.,Mihail Bota
365,wide-range neuron Larriva-Sahd (Larriva-Sahd),The shape and dimensions of the dendritic field have strong implications for connectivity (Szentagothai, 1990, Stepanyants and Chklovskii, 2005) and accordingly, projection neurons in the Ov fall into two broad classes, namely, wide-range (larger than 300 micrometers) and constrained-range dendritic fields.,Histological and cytological study of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis in adult rat.
