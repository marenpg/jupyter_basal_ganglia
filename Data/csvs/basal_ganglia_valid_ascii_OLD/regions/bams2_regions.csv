Rostral to and including at bregma 1.20 (0.65 from Waxholm bregma), Swanson's caudoputamen is contained in Waxholm's striatum, with borders more or less identical. At 0.95 from bregma (0.33 from Waxholm bregma), Swanson's fundus of striatum is situated inside WHS' caudoputamen. However, this is the only overlap between WHS caudoputamen and Swanson's fundus of striatum. More posteriorly, Swanson's fundus of striatum is situated within Waxholm's basal forebrain. In the remaining sections, WHS' caudoputamen seems more or less identical to Swanson's caudoputamen, although note that the ventral border of Swanson's caudoputamen is not always defined, and might be defined slightly differently in some of these posterior sections."

30,31,Ectorhinal area,"Anteriorly, Swanson's ectorhinal cortex overlaps both perirhinal areas 35 and 36 in the WHS. Its WHS counterpart should be the perirhinal area 36 (PER36), but the WHS PER36 seems to have a much larger dorsal extent than Swanson's ectorhinal area. Posteriorly, Swanson's ectorhinal area extends to include the entire WHS postrhinal cortex and also overlaps with WHS temporal association cortex."
31,32,Entorhinal area,"Swanson's entorhinal area comprises a lateral part, a medial part, and a medial part, ventral zone. The lateral part largely overlaps with WHS lateral entorhinal cortex but also has areas overlapping with the WHS postrhinal cortex. The medial part has some overlap with the parasubiculum rostrally, but otherwise largely corresponds to WHS medial entorhinal cortex."
32,33,Fundus of the striatum,"At +0.95 from bregma (+0.33 from Waxholm bregma), the fundus of striatum is situated inside the WHS' caudoputamen. However, this is the only overlap between WHS caudoputamen and Swanson's fundus of striatum. At 1.20 (0.65 from Waxholm bregma), the fundus of striatum appears in Swanson's atlas in the area corresponding to the lateral part of the WHS accumbens nucleus, shell. However, it is only situated in WHS' nucleus accumbens in this one section. More posteriorly, Swanson's fundus of striatum is situated within Waxholm's basal forebrain. "
33,34,Globus pallidus,"Swanson's globus pallidus consists of a lateral and a medial segment (called external and internal segment in version 3). The WHS has an globus pallidus external part consisting of a lateral and a medial part. Both of Swanson's lateral and medial segment overlap with both of the WHS globus pallidus external parts. In addition, Swanson's globus pallidus internal segment overlaps with the WHS entopeduncular nucleus."
34,35,Globus pallidus external segment,"Swanson's globus pallidus external segment (GPe) overlaps with the WHS globus pallidus external, lateral part (GPEl). The rostral part of Swanson's GPe is very similar to the WHS GPEl, but the WHS GPEl appear to be sligthly larger at its rostral extreme. From Swanson's plate 21, the GPe overlaps with WHS GPEl, but not fully because of the globus pallidus external, medial part (GPEm) appearing in the WHS. In these intermediate levels, it seems that Swanson's GPE has a larger ventral extent than the combined WHS GPEl and GPEm. Caudally, from Swanson's plate 25, the GPe is part of the WHS GPEl, but covers only its most lateral part. The anteroposterior extent of the structures appear to be equal. At intermediate levels of Swanson's globus pallidus external segment (from plate 21), its medial part inculdes WHS globus pallidus external, medial part (GPEm). The most posterior end of the WHS GPEm is situated in the ventral part of Swanson's globus pallidus internal segment, however."
35,36,Globus pallidus internal segment,"At -1.08 from bregma (-1.85 from Waxholm bregma), Swanson's globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) appears directly medially to the external segment. It overlaps both the WHS globus pallidus external lateral part (GPEl) and globus pallidus external, medial part (GPEm). At these levels, the overlap with the GPEl is primarily in the dorsal part of Swanson's GPi, while the overlap with the GPEm is in the ventral Swanson GPi. However, Swanson's GPi appears to have a larger ventral extent than the WHS GPEm. It overlaps the external globus pallidus region in WHS until -1.78 from bregma (-2.39 from Waxholm bregma), where Swanson's internal segment becomes incapsulated in the internal capsule. At -1.78 from bregma (-2.39 from Waxholm bregma), Swanson's internal segment becomes incapsulated in the internal capsule, but is much more elongated than Waxholms entopeduncular nucleus and does not match the shape. These seem to have quite similar anteroposterior extent, but still only seem to overlap slightly."
36,37,Globus pallidus lateral segment,"Swanson's globus pallidus lateral segment (GPl) overlaps with the WHS globus pallidus external, lateral part (GPEl). The rostral part of Swanson's GPl is very similar to the WHS GPEl, but the WHS GPEl appear to be sligthly larger at its rostral extreme. From Swanson's plate 21, the GPl overlaps with WHS GPEl, but not fully because of the globus pallidus external, medial part (GPEm) appearing in the WHS. In these intermediate levels, it seems that Swanson's GPl has a larger ventral extent than the combined WHS GPEl and GPEm. Caudally, from Swanson's plate 25, the GPl is part of the WHS GPEl, but covers only its most lateral part. The anteroposterior extent of the structures appear to be equal. At intermediate levels of Swanson's globus pallidus lateral segment (from plate 21), its medial part includes WHS globus pallidus external, medial part (GPEm). The most posterior end of the WHS GPEm is situated in the ventral part of Swanson's globus pallidus internal segment, however."
37,38,Globus pallidus medial segment,"At -1.78 from bregma (-2.39 from Waxholm bregma), Swanson's medial segment becomes incapsulated in the internal capsule, but is much more elongated than Waxholms entopeduncular nucleus and does not match the shape. These seem to have quite similar anteroposterior extent, but still only seem to overlap slightly."
38,39,Gustatory areas,"At its rostral extreme, Swanson's gustatory areas overlap with the WHS dorsolateral orbital cortex. After this, Swanson's area overlaps with several cortical regions in the WHS, primarily the dysgranular insular cortex and granular insular cortex. However, at some intermediate levels it seems that the most dorsal part of Swanson's gustatory areas also overlap with WHS primary somatosensory area, upper lip region (face)"
39,40,Infralimbic area,"The infralimbic area in Swanson's atlas is very similar to WHS infralimbic cortex.

51,53,Nucleus accumbens,"Swanson's nucleus accumbens (ACB) largely includes the WHS accumbens nucleus, shell, but is slightly more narrowly defined. In particular, WHS nucleus accumbens, shell is visible at a more rostral level than the Swanson ACB. In this area, the WHS nucleus accumbens shell overlaps with olfactory areas in the Swanson atlas. From Swanson's plate 10, the ACB includes the WHS accumbens nucleus, shell, with borders that look fairly similar (although the dorsal border with the caudoputamen appears to be slightly more dorsally placed in the Swanson atlas). Swanson's nucleus accumbens (ACB) furthermore includes the WHS accumbens nucleus, core. The WHS region is included in the ACB throughout the latters anteroposterior extent."

64,66,Prelimbic area,"At its rostral extreme, Swanson's prelimbic area overlaps with WHS frontal association cortex. More posteriorly, it overlaps WHS medial orbital cortex and prelimbic cortex. It seems that rostrally, the Swanson prelimbic area is larger than its WHS counterpart, with the dorsal part corresponding to WHS prelimbic cortex and the ventral part to WHS medial orbital cortex. At the posterior end of Swanson's prelimbic area, the WHS region is larger (also extending dorsally into Swanson's dorsal anterior cingulate area). "
65,67,Primary motor area,"At its rostral extreme, Swanson's primary motor area overlaps WHS dorsolateral orbital cortex. Throughout the rest of the area, it overlaps both WHS primary and secondary motor cortex, as well as the frontal cortex, area 3. In anterior levels, the correspondence with WHS primary motor cortex is quite good. However, Swanson's primary motor area extends more medially than its WHS counterpart at intermediate and caudal levels, and in this area overlaps with WHS secondary motor area."
66,68,Retrorubral area,Swanson's Retrorubral area (RR) is part of the WHS Brainstem

The substantia nigra, lateral part in WHS overlaps both subdivisions in the Swanson atlas. Generally, the substantia nigra of Waxholm appears slightly bigger than that of Swanson."
72,74,Substantia nigra compact part,"WHS' substantia nigra compact part (SNC) makes up most of Swanson's structure with the same name, but does not fully cover it. However, the WHS substantia nigra lateral part also overlaps with Swanson's substantia nigra pars compacta, complicating the relationship slightly. The substantia nigra, lateral part in WHS overlaps with Swanson's substantia nigra, compact part, but with a very small area of overlap that is hard to define clearly."
73,75,Substantia nigra reticular part,"WHS' substantia nigra reticular part makes up most of Swanson's substantia nigra reticular part. However, Waxholm's substantia nigra lateral part also overlaps with Swanson's substantia nigra pars reticulata, complicating the relationship slightly.

77,79,Ventral tegmental area,"Rostrally, Swanson's ventral tegmental area has a larger medial extent than the same area in WHS. In these rostral areas, the structures appear quite different and the nature of the overlap is hard to define. At intermediate levels, from Swanson's plate 36, the regions are more simialar, but the Swanson VTA has a dorsal extention that is not seen in the WHS VTA. Caudally, the WHS VTA seems to be placed more medially compared to Swanson's VTA. In sum, the two VTA delineations share quite a lot of their respective areas, but there are some areas of non-overlap that is primarily related to Swanson's version being bigger."
78,80,Visceral area,"Rostrally, Swanson's visceral area overlaps the WHS granular insular cortex ventrally and the secondary somatosensory cortex dorsally. More caudally, the overlap is with the granular insular cortex dorsally and the dysgranular insular cortex ventrally."
