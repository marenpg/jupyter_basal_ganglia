948,"A class of large neuroglial (macroglial) cells in the central nervous system - the largest and most numerous neuroglial cells in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytes (from ""star"" cells) are irregularly shaped with many long processes, including those with ""end feet"" which form the glial (limiting) membrane.  The cell body of an astrocyte spans 10-20 microns and its processes radiate out for another 20-30 microns. Astrocytes stain for the intermediate filament GFAP.  Astrocytes are recognized in the transmission electron microscope by their irregular shape, numerous glycogen granules, a relatively clear cytoplasm and bundles of intermediate filaments (adapted from MSH and Synapse Web)., A class of large neuroglial (macroglial) cells in the central nervous system - the largest and most numerous neuroglial cells in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytes (from ""star"" cells) are irregularly shaped with many long processes, including those with ""end feet"" which form the glial (limiting) membrane and directly and indirectly contribute to the blood-brain barrier. They regulate the extracellular ionic and chemical environment, and ""reactive astrocytes"" (along with microglia) respond to injury (MSH).",http://uri.interlex.org/base/ilx_0100947,70,4,

7498,"The basic cellular units of nervous tissue. Neurons are polarized cells with defined regions consisting of the cell body, an axon, and dendrites, although some types of neurons lack axons or dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system. Neurons can be classified a number of different ways: anatomical, physiological, and developmental.  Anatomical classes are defined first by the location of the neuron in the nervous system.  Neurons are further distinguished from each other by features which include dendritic and axon morphology.  Anatomical features also include synaptic connectivity (inputs and outputs) and molecular phenotype(the particular neurotransmitters, receptors, and ion channels expressed by a neuron).  Neurons can be classified by their physiological properties.  This includes their general function (Sensory, motor, interneuron).  Functions can also include whether the neuron is a relay neuron or a local interneuron or whether it is involved in sensory processing or correction of motor responses.  Physiological actions can also include the firing properties of the neuron (bursting, tonic, quiescent).  Developmental classifications of neurons are based upon the lineage that the cell derives from.  The number of neurons in a particular class can vary over orders of magnitude from individual neurons in some classes to millions of neurons in other classes.",http://uri.interlex.org/base/ilx_0107497,42,,1
