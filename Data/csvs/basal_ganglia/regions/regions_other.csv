0,6,Sw04_Caudoputamen,6,CP,"Defined as the dorsal region of the striatum, immidiately dorsal to the nucleus accumbens, distinguished based on the presence of massive fiber bundles coursing through the structure"
1,7,Sw04_Nucleus accumbens,6,ACB,Defined as the part of the ventromedial striatum lacking massive traversing fiber bundles. No core/shell delineations
2,8,Sw04_Striatal fundus,6,FS,"A ventrolateral part of the striatum, with more heterogeneous cytoarchitecture than the Cp and ACB. Corresponds to the LAcbSh in Paxinos atlases, but with a larger rostrocaudal extent (occupying some IPAC regions) Paxinos' LSS is found within this region."
3,9,Sw04_Globus pallidus external segment,6,Gpe,"The lateral part of the globus pallidus. In this atlas, the part usually considered GPe is divided into GPe and GPi, and the latter stretches into the internal capsule more caudally"
4,10,Sw04_Globus pallidus internal segment,6,Gpi,"The medial/internal part of the globus pallidus. In this atlas, the part usually considered GPe is divided into GPe and GPi, and the latter stretches into the internal capsule more caudally"
5,11,Sw04_Substantia innominata,6,SI,"Region situated between the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The rostral part of the SI seems to correspond well with the VP, but more caudally it occupies a region that is classified by Paxinos as VP, cell bridge of striatum, SIB, and LPO."
6,12,Sw04_Magnocellular nucleus,6,MA,"Rodent ""homologue"" to the primate nucleus of Meynert. It consists of a group of cholinergic neurons and is situated directly deep (possibly seen as part of) the SI. No other basal nuclei components are been indicated, as opposed to in Paxinos. The MA occupies roughly the same area as Paxinos' MCPO (later LDB)"
