0,0,6,Caudoputamen,6,0,CP,"Defined as the dorsal region of the striatum, immidiately dorsal to the nucleus accumbens, distinguished based on the presence of massive fiber bundles coursing through the structure"
1,1,7,Nucleus accumbens,6,0,ACB,Defined as the part of the ventromedial striatum lacking massive traversing fiber bundles. No core/shell delineations
2,2,8,Striatal fundus,6,0,FS,"A ventrolateral part of the striatum, with more heterogeneous cytoarchitecture than the Cp and ACB. Corresponds to the LAcbSh in Paxinos atlases, but with a larger rostrocaudal extent (occupying some IPAC regions) Paxinos' LSS is found within this region."
