## Basal Nuclei:
351, Basal nucleus of the dorsal horn (Swanson-1998),
Basal nucleus of the spinal cord (Swanson-2004), identical,
Collator note: Swanson 2004 nomenclature is very similar to Swanson 1998 version. For changes that were performed between Swanson 1998 and 2004 versions; please check "Changes to the original Atlas" ; page 7.,

Tasks:
1. List all nomenclatures referenced.
2. Check uniqueness of e_uid, id and v_uid
3. v_status is a letter, print it out to se distinct

## Basal Nuclei
101,101,Rat,Basal Nuclei,gray matter,BG,Swanson,Swanson-1998,
In mammals; lateral and medial ventricular ridges develop into the classical striatum and pallidum; respectively (see Alvarez-Bolado and Swanson 1996 for review). To simplify endbrain organization; we have placed all regions that appear to develop from the ventricular ridges into either the pallidum or striatum; broadly defined. In general; cortex projects to striatum (and sometimes pallidum) via excitatory inputs; striatum projects to pallidum via inhibitory inputs; and both striatum and pallidum generate inhibitory decending projections. Justification for the organization scheme presented here; based on connections; is in preparation.,
