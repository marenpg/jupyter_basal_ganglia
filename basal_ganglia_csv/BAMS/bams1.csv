However; instead of calling it a “subdivision” as McDonald did; we have referred to it as the juxtacapsular nucleus. The appearance of neurons in the oval and juxtacapsular nuclei differs in Golgi preparations (McDonald; ‘83); and they are quite different in their immunohistochemical properties as well (Ju et al.; ’89). It is difficult to agree with McDonald; however; that the neurons in the rest of the BST are rather similar. It seems to us; therefore; that it is difficult to divide the BST into a lateral and a medial division on the basis of limited cytoarchitectonic criteria.,Ju G. & Swanson L.W.

His lateral division corresponds only to our lateral area of the anterior division; whereas his description of the main body of the lateral division corresponds to our oval nucleus. The appearance of neurons in the oval and juxtacapsular nuclei differs in Golgi preparations (McDonald; ‘83); and they are quite different in their immunohistochemical properties as well (Ju et al.; ’89). It is difficult to agree with McDonald; however; that the neurons in the rest of the BST are rather similar.

His lateral division corresponds only to our lateral area of the anterior division; whereas his description of the main body of the lateral division corresponds to our oval nucleus. The appearance of neurons in the oval and juxtacapsular nuclei differs in Golgi preparations (McDonald; ‘83); and they are quite different in their immunohistochemical properties as well (Ju et al.; ’89). It is difficult to agree with McDonald; however; that the neurons in the rest of the BST are rather similar.

975,Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Gurdjian),Bed of stria terminalis (Johnston),overlap,Johnston ('23) has described this for the rat. He draws attention to the fact that it is found in the plane of the anterior commissure and becomes continuons with the head of the caudate and the nucleus accumbens rostrally; while caudally it follows the fornix columns to the hypothalamus. He thinks that this bed nucleus accompanies the stria all the way through its course from the amygdaloid complex. However; we want to stress this one point: that the stria terminalis in its course on the ventrolateral aspect of the fornix is accompanied by very few nerve cells. Thus; we have not been able to see a nerve cell in as many as fifteen to twenty sections in the serial order; in the preparations at hand. It is also noted that a close relation exists between this and the bed nucleus of the anterior commissure.,Gurdjian E.S.; (1925),http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Gurdjian E.S.; (1925),13946,975,28eecaa0-9bf7-55e8-89db-2aa1ae4209d8,2016-05-09 16:57:11,C,1.4628130310509E9
